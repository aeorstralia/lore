Hearing of a need, a group of adventure's at the Heeler's house to find out what the problem could be.


[17/03/2023 10:04 AM] Bandit
Bandit leans forward in his chair, looking at the group of adventurers gathered before him. His brow is furrowed with worry as he begins to speak.

**"You lot here about the job?  Listen up, fellas. this one's a bit urgent yeah?   There this outpost down to the southwest that's supposed to be keepin' watch over the farms out that way. But we haven't heard from 'em in weeks, and that's got me worried. So I need ya to head out there and find out what's goin' on."**

He leans back in his chair, crossing his arms and fixing the adventurers with a stern look.

**"I don't know what kind of trouble you might find out there, but I do know that we can't let those farms be vulnerable to any threats. Yous up for the job?"**


[17/03/2023 10:07 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I'm good, maybe we find something besides spiders and man eating toads south"**


[17/03/2023 10:17 AM] Bandit
**"Yeah I heard about that.  Pretty brave stuff.  Someone said you jumped head first into a toad to pull a kangaroo out.  Is that right?"** Bandit says to you with a wink.


[17/03/2023 10:19 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Laughing **"something like that."**


[17/03/2023 10:37 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Smiling enthusiastically. **"I heard something was up and as my master at the Monastery taught me, 'Help when you are able'. So that's what I'm here for. I am able and willing sir!"**


[17/03/2023 2:26 PM] deamonlord
"I vow to earn my keep for your hospitality here. And maybe earn some gold to pay the nice cafe owner"


[17/03/2023 3:47 PM] pender16
**‚ÄùI sssssseem to be sssssstuck here. May assss vell make zhe bessst of it‚Äù** Asper says in his thick Soviet accent and snaky lisp.


[17/03/2023 8:23 PM] Bandit
**"Sounds like you bunch'll do a'right then.  Now the terriers told me the top dog down there is called Robbo and we a sent half a dozen more down lead by a bloke named Jezza.  Here I'll show yous on a  map where yous are going."** He pulls out an old paper map that looks like it once mapped a sprawling urban metropolis but has been drawn over with pen and pencil presumably to show the new world since it crashed into Faer√ªn.  Bandit points out a location that looks like it's around a days travel from the walls.  **"There it is.  There's a few farms around, but that location has a pretty good view all round.  Any questions 'fore yous head off?"**


[17/03/2023 10:36 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Looking at the map then back to Bandit. **"Is this a tower type of outpost, or just a standard size building and barracks for protection? I have a new friend I met here named Kherdun who would find it most interesting either way, so I will have to tell him all about it when I get back!"**


[18/03/2023 12:27 AM] Bandit
**"Ya know that's a pretty good question."**  He scratches his head.  **"I've never been down that way myself ya know.  Place is called Wacol.  Used to be a jail I think.  Nah wait, correctional centre they called it, so it's probably fenced, but there might be towers too."**


[18/03/2023 7:20 AM] deamonlord
"Should we expect anything there from before you came here?"


[19/03/2023 3:33 AM] pender16
**‚ÄùAnd how are ve getting vhere?‚Äù** Asper asks with no understanding that walking there is a possibility


[19/03/2023 3:44 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Just now noticing the new person that he has never seen before. **"Wow! I've never met someone like you. How great is my life? Who are you my fine scaled friend? My name is Phan Tasm. I'm a Tabaxi monk."**


[19/03/2023 11:54 AM] Bandit
Bandit scratches behind his ear for a few seconds at Greg's question.  **"Nah.  Pretty sure all that got messed up when our continent decided to go plane surfing ay.  Apparently they fixed it up since then but it's more of an outpost than a jail now."** He turns to Asper.  **"Don't you have your own feet?"** He looks down at Asper's tail.  **"Oh I guess you don't.  Well you might be able to hire someone to take you down there in a cart, but I don't know that the roads are all that good.  Not like Bruce's Way."**


[20/03/2023 8:42 AM] pender16
**‚ÄùNo skyships or spell jammers?!‚Äù** he asks incredulously


[20/03/2023 9:18 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"sorry we're gonna have to walk it. Sounds like this might not be your cuppa as the locals say"**


[20/03/2023 9:20 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer looks over at Asper, **"I can give you a leg if you think that'd be helpful"**

[20/03/2023 1:15 PM] Bandit
**"Dunno what those are sorry mate.  Here.  I've made a bit of a copy of the map for yous.  Might help you out."** he says handing over a sheet of paper.  **"Hope it helps you and good luck ay."**


[20/03/2023 10:33 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Looking at the rest of the group especially the snake creature, having heard of Yuan-ti before from books but never having seen them in real life, speaks up. **"Well, I'm ready when you all are.  Sorry I can't carry you as I'm just a small fella but I think we should be able to make it traveling aground, by looking at the map, just fine."**


[21/03/2023 2:27 PM] deamonlord
"Let's head out then. As the Matrons would say: quicker you're done, the less beatings you'll get." Before turning and heading out in the opposite direction.


[21/03/2023 2:57 PM] pender16
**‚ÄùVell I guess I could valk. I just haven‚Äôt trekked like vhat in a vhile‚Äù** Asper says as he begins to slither his way after the rest of the party.


[21/03/2023 9:58 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding to the others. **"hope no one had arachnophobia"**

[22/03/2023 8:26 PM] Bandit
**"See yas later!  Good luck!  Have fun storming the castle!"**


[22/03/2023 8:42 PM] WMDM
Before long you pass through the land gates to the south west.  Bandit's map is rough but accurate and you make good time picking your way between the abandoned buildings trying to stay on the roads outside the walls.  After about an hour of travelling you hear a commotion ahead of you just over the rise.


[22/03/2023 8:44 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Ears pricking up. **"What's that? Can you guys see anything?"**


[22/03/2023 10:58 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Still hearing the commotion phan ducks down a little and runs forward to see if he can see what's going on, stumbling a bit in the middle of his run. Cursing himself he tries to see what is up there but then a branch hits his eye from the bush he was trying to hide behind.


[22/03/2023 11:05 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer strides up the road a space and looks out


[23/03/2023 8:47 AM] WMDM
Over the rise, 150 ft. away, you see a cart stacked high with what looks like a families belongings stopped on the road.  It's hitched to a old looking donkey and there is a middle aged man, woman and two children just visible behind them.  Surrounding the cart are five thugs.  One of them looks to be the leader and is pointing a crossbow at the cart driver.  As Phan stumbles over the ridge, Hemmer just catches one of the thugs say **"Boss.  Up there."** and the lead thug looks in the direction of the adventurers.


[23/03/2023 8:57 AM] deamonlord
Greg tries to duck down to avoid being spotted, leaving his head visible. "Hey! Do you see anything?"


[23/03/2023 9:54 AM] pender16
Asper listens carefully with his wide flaps and asks Hemmer and Phan **‚ÄùAre you two going to ssssssssttick together?‚Äù**


[23/03/2023 10:21 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding in answer to the question


[23/03/2023 10:23 AM] pender16
Asper points his gauntlet at Phan like a reptilian Buzz Lightyear and a thin blue streak shoots out and then materializes as a blue ethereal tether between Phan and Hemmer. **‚ÄùVhat should let you borrow some energy from eachovher vhen you need to‚Äù**


[23/03/2023 10:28 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"looks like bandits, better than spiders I reckon"** shifting his shield forward and pulling his pouch out Shouting **"hello I have gold"**


[23/03/2023 10:30 AM] WMDM
The leader of the thugs takes a few steps towards you and trains his crossbow on you instead of the driver.  **"Come give it to us then."**


[23/03/2023 10:32 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"come up and get it, let them be on their way"** dropping it on the ground infront of him


[23/03/2023 10:35 AM] WMDM
The thug looks at the smallest of his companions, a human boy who looks like he's still a teenager, and nods his head towards the bag.  The teen scurries over keeping eyes on you and assessing you as he gets closer.  You notice he's keeping one hand on his sword hilt and he has his own crossbow slung over his shoulder.


[23/03/2023 10:37 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Shaking his head, saying just loud enough for the boy, **"touching that bag isnt in your best interest boy.  Send someone bigger, it's to heavy for you"**


[23/03/2023 10:48 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Gripping his spear in a battle ready hold, Phan steps forward by Hemmer. **"If you are looking to try someone smaller than you Mr. Big Stuff down there, I'm here ready. Though to be honest, it would absolutely be in your best interest to stow your weapons and leave."**


[23/03/2023 11:25 AM] WMDM
The boy stops 5 feet form the bag with a worried look on his face, then looks back to his boss.  Who nods then spits on the ground.


[23/03/2023 11:26 AM] WMDM
The boy seems conflicted, but then suddenly makes a grab for the bag.


[23/03/2023 11:32 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding to Phan


[23/03/2023 11:50 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"let him take it"**


[23/03/2023 11:52 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**gonna need a friend for that bag"**


[23/03/2023 11:53 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan stands back a step but keeps the spear at the ready just in case waiting to see what happens.


[23/03/2023 11:54 AM] WMDM
The teen grabs the bag and starts dragging it away as fast as he can.  He's clearly no weakling despite his youth.


[23/03/2023 11:55 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer starts walking after him nodding at the rest off them


[23/03/2023 11:56 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Quietly to Hemmer. **"Let's definitely follow as the family still has not left."**


[23/03/2023 11:58 AM] WMDM
He picks up the pace as he sees you following.  As he gets closer the leader looks at the bag's size in surprise, but nods to the others then the approaching adventurers.  The four of them train their crossbows on you as you approach.  **"That's far enough then."** he calls out once you 60 feet away.


[23/03/2023 12:02 PM] pender16
Just before Hemmer walks forward and while Asper is still out of sight he recites an incantation and the blue orb at the center of his shield pulses and everyone feels a sense of courage roll over them.


[23/03/2023 12:03 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"I still see the innocents here that week supposed to be let go to earn that bag. Let them go. You have us to keep you company now."**


[23/03/2023 12:09 PM] pender16
Asper slithers forward looking formidable in his armor and hisses **‚ÄùReleassssssse vhem or vhe burglars vill become vhe burgalees‚Äù**


[23/03/2023 12:19 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan takes one step forward and to the side to put himself just in front of the rest of the group trying to make sure he has sight of everyone in the cart to see if they are ok.


[23/03/2023 12:26 PM] WMDM
Phan steps forward and sees that the family seems unharmed.  At the same time the leader yells **"I said don't come any closer!"**


[23/03/2023 12:36 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Smiling at the leader. **"I guess you've never heard that cats really don't follow directions well. You said don't move, and we said let the family go. Seems neither of us are good at listening."**


[23/03/2023 12:57 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"your boy doesn't listen well either. "** stepping up next to Phan.  **" probably want to rethink your life choices.  Gond is watching and you seem to be left wanting. Now I'm not here to convert you so that only leaves us with so many options"**


[23/03/2023 1:20 PM] pender16
**‚ÄùVe don‚Äôt vant to hurt you but, I think the Big Blue Guy would vant us to protect thisssss family‚Äù** his accent as thick as ever as he gets excited for close quarters combat it had been awhile since he‚Äôd done any combat face to face.


[23/03/2023 3:17 PM] WMDM
The teen finishes dashing back to the group and drops the bag before turning and drawing his sword.
The leader thug decides a crossbow is too good for you a throws a pair of daggers in your general direction.  The other thugs land crossbow bolts in the dirt near you, but not really all that near you.


[24/03/2023 2:24 AM] pender16
Understanding how his crew worked Asper hopes that taking out the boss would cause the others to lose their resolve so he rushes forward and plants his shield in the ground and gives the orb a punch from the back. It lights up and fires a beam of energy toward the leader of the thugs but misses high. **‚ÄùGah‚Äù** Asper hisses out.


[24/03/2023 5:49 AM] deamonlord
Greg rushes up beside Asper staff held ready to strike the first one that comes close


[24/03/2023 5:59 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer rushes forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with his allies. Stopping and holding his shield in front of him he unleashes a bolt of energy at the Captain


[24/03/2023 6:08 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
As everyone starts to move, out of the corner of their eyes they see phan crouch down and almost go to all four limbs before pouncing with agility they haven't seen before. Leaping with speed, Phan bolts to the shiny  target that has now caught his attention first attacking with his spear finding purchase right through the abdomen then he quickly swipes out with a flurry of blows scratching out with his claws leaving gashes across the face and arms of this shining being. As the glow has faded from him he looks in front of himself at the leader. **"This is now your last warning for all of you. Leave this road and never return or tempt the fates with us."**


[24/03/2023 6:46 AM] WMDM
The teen circles around Phan and slashes at his back but misses.  The leader clutches his wounds and circles around the cart for cover and moves out of sight yelling **"Get the bastards!"**


[24/03/2023 6:52 AM] WMDM
The rest of the thugs surround Phan and slash all around him, only one of them getting in a lucky hit.


[24/03/2023 8:52 AM] pender16
Asper looks toward the battered thug captain and opens his mouth but no sound comes out, or at least none his companions can hear. But the captain doubles over clasping the sides of his head.


[24/03/2023 9:01 AM] deamonlord
Greg rushes to the closet enemy, striking out with his staff and connecting with a solid hit, following it up with a quick kick to the leg


[24/03/2023 9:10 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer rushes to Phan's side, smashing his mace into the bandit. Then calls upon Gond bringing a forging hammer into existence next to the bandit leader, and smashing him in the head with it.


[24/03/2023 9:38 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan continues his onslaught not moving from his spot and finishes off 2 that were getting injured by the others. He seemed to get a little more vitality as soon as the first opponent dropped. He then looks to the last 2. **"What kind of decision are you going to make here? "**


[24/03/2023 11:52 AM] WMDM
The last of the thugs drop their weapons and run.


[24/03/2023 12:41 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer starts to pick up the weapons and take anything made of metal off the bodies.  Looking up at the travelers **"your free to be on about your way. "**


[24/03/2023 1:32 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"Though, before you go, do you know anything about the southern outpost? Apparently no one has been heard from in a while."**


[24/03/2023 11:45 PM] WMDM
Hemmer finds a crossbows and scimitar on each of them.  The leader has two daggers as well as a crossbow and they have a handful of bolts each.


[24/03/2023 11:53 PM] WMDM
The family in the cart look on, their faces filled with gratitude and relief. The father hops down and steps forward, his hand to shake. **"Thank you,"** he says, his voice shaking with emotion. **"We don't know what we would have done without you."**  The wife and the children echoed his thanks, their faces expressing a mix of fear, relief, and gratitude.  The father pulls off his hat and holds it against his chest, his face scrunched up and he looks down sorrowfully.

**"That place.  Well we had to escape.  Whole thing got over run didn't it.  We started packing to get the kids out when the first spiders showed up."** He takes another few steps away from the cart and the young ears of his children.  **"Only just got the wagons packed and on the road when the rest showed up.  Must have been a dozen of them.  Huge things.  Never seen 'em so big.  Climbed straight over the fences like they were nothing."**


[24/03/2023 11:56 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"Oooo... big spiders. That sounds fascinating.  Are they bigger than me?"**


[25/03/2023 12:08 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Phan if they are like the last batch of spiders then you would be just a snack to them. "** looking at the others seeing Hope's face replace each of theirs


[25/03/2023 12:20 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"Oh, now I'm really curious about these spiders.  They sound fascinating. Think I could ride one?"**


[25/03/2023 12:23 AM] pender16
**‚ÄùIn Wildssssssspace ve heard rumours about ssssspidersssss vhe size of asteroidssssss that would capture whole ships and pick off vhe crew one by one‚Äù**


[25/03/2023 12:25 AM] WMDM
The father's face looks more and more horrified.  **"Well.  Yeah.  I've got the kids to think of, so I'll just keep heading into Brisbandit where it's hopefully safer.  Thanks so much for dealing with those bandits."**


[25/03/2023 12:37 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding, **"Its much safer there. You aren't far off from there at this point, safe travels"**


[25/03/2023 1:00 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan nods.  **"Say hi to the Terriers for us! They will greet you at the gate."**


[25/03/2023 1:05 AM] pender16
**‚ÄùAnd check in wivh vhe Big Blue Guy. He‚Äôsssssss odd but caring and will make sure you have a roof over your head.‚Äù**


[25/03/2023 6:13 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"Well, that seems like a challenge for us. Let us get moving out to the Outpost and see if we can't clear those pesks."**


[25/03/2023 6:16 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Fire worked well on them. Especially if we can get them still in their webs. '**


[25/03/2023 8:51 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Looking at his spear and claws, **"Fire, huh? Hmmm... What about sharp pointy and scratchy things? I'm not quite equipped for fire."**


[25/03/2023 9:03 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"those worked as well, just have to get a lot closer to them"**


[25/03/2023 10:17 AM] WMDM
**"Thanking you again sirs.  Best of luck to you.  You'll need it."** he shakes the reigns and the donkey plods on along the road.


[25/03/2023 10:19 AM] WMDM
After another few hours of travel the sun is low on the horizon and the outpost is still nowhere in sight.  The buildings have become more sparse and the roads wider, but less maintained.


[25/03/2023 11:10 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Looking at the map and the sky. **"Think we should find a place to camp for the night? I'm excited to see big spiders... But I would rather not do it at night."**


[25/03/2023 11:21 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Yea it would be much better to come at them in the morning hopefully before they really start moving for the day. I have already lost one companion to these spiders, I'm not really looking to add more reliefs to the wall at Panache and Co"**


[25/03/2023 11:37 AM] WMDM
Phan follows his nose and the sound of running water and soon comes across a scenic riverbank.  It is a lush and peaceful wilderness area situated beside a gently flowing river that is teeming with fish. The area is surrounded by tall trees that provide shade and protection from the sun, making it excellent for those looking to relax and enjoy nature. The riverbank is dotted with flat stones and rocks that are perfect for sitting on while fishing, and the water is crystal clear and cool.


[25/03/2023 11:49 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer starts to set a small fire.  Then takes out a couple of the links of chainmail shaping them into hooks for fishing **"someone want to try their luck?"**


[25/03/2023 11:50 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"This will do nicely! Shall we take turns keeping watch tonight? Just in case there's something that wants to eat us? I'll take the first watch if we do."**


[25/03/2023 11:56 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Tossing a line into the water with the  freshly made hook.  **"I'll take a watch"**


[25/03/2023 12:20 PM] deamonlord
"You have outdone yourself on this site. I shall take a watch for us as well. Hemmer, do you wish to speak of this comrade you have lost? Surely they couldn't have been to strong to be felled by spiders"


[25/03/2023 12:32 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**Hope, was a solid warrior, and a priest of Selune. "** trying to pay more attention to the fishing line than it really requires. **"Hope was the best of the Peanut Gallery, Sergio our sword, Tibs our face, but Hope was our heart. We were surrounded by spiders and he was covered in the little ones. I tried to help him and failed"**


[25/03/2023 12:35 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan sees Hemmer start fishing and decides to wade a little into the river and starts catching a few with his claws.


[25/03/2023 1:49 PM] deamonlord
"I apologize for insulting your companion, Hopefully, this enterprise has less death?"


[25/03/2023 1:57 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"That would be the Hope"** smirking slightly at the word play


[26/03/2023 12:05 PM] WMDM
The troupe settles down and the gentle sounds of the trickling water nearby soon lull those who aren't on watch to sleep.  During Greg's watch he wanders the area quietly.  At one stage he hears the noise of sticks snapping across the stream.  It could be more bandits, or it could just be an animal.  As he stares across trying to see if it's a concern or not, the ground beneath his feet begins to shift and buckle, and before he knows it, the earth gives way beneath them.  (@Greg/Cinder/Leyana  Greg needs to make a DC15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.


[26/03/2023 1:18 PM] WMDM
Greg manages to scramble back easily onto solid ground as a small section of the river bank slides into the flowing water and quietly dissolves into the ebbing stream.


[26/03/2023 1:19 PM] deamonlord
"What in Loths wetdream was that? "


[26/03/2023 1:22 PM] deamonlord
Greg moves closer to investigate


[26/03/2023 1:25 PM] WMDM
Walking the river bank Greg finds another section that's a little soft and notes to avoid it.  The rest of his watch passes without incident.


[26/03/2023 1:26 PM] deamonlord
Greg walks over to Asper and shakes them. "Ay, your turn for the watch, up ya get "


[26/03/2023 3:02 PM] pender16
Asper wakes up and hisses a bit. Was he angry or was that A Yuan-TI yawn? It was hard to tell but he got up all the same and went to do his shift **‚ÄùAnyvhing happen during your vatch?‚Äù**


[26/03/2023 3:23 PM] deamonlord
"The ground around the river bank collapsed, and it all looks wonky, so careful where you walk...or...slither?"


[26/03/2023 10:58 PM] pender16
**‚ÄùSsstay away from vhe river. Got it.‚Äù** and he slithers off to continue the watch


[26/03/2023 11:03 PM] WMDM
The rest of the morning passes without incident.  The sun begins to rise slowly over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the sky. Dew droplets sparkle like diamonds on the grass, leaves, and flowers. The air is crisp and cool, and a light breeze rustles the leaves of the trees. As the light grows stronger, an incredible sight catches Asper's eye - a giant spider web, at least thirty feet across, stretching between two trees on the other side of the riverbank.


[26/03/2023 11:03 PM] WMDM
The web's owner however is nowhere to be seen.

Asper begins making the rounds to wake everyone up.


[27/03/2023 2:14 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Yawning and Smiling. **"Good morning Mr. Asper. Hope your night was pleasant too."**


[27/03/2023 4:20 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Sitting up slowly **"see anything interesting last night?"** reaching over and attaching his leg, before putting his boot on and standing up


[27/03/2023 8:33 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Noticing the giant web **"Get ready lads, that"** pointing at it **"means they are close"**


[27/03/2023 8:50 AM] deamonlord
"You have to experience with them, how close do you think they are?"


[27/03/2023 8:52 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"that wasn't there when we bedded down. They came in over night and spun up a home"** getting his armor on. **"We need to deal with this now, hopefully its still resting in there"**


[27/03/2023 9:07 AM] pender16
**‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt see that in the dark of night but it was there glistening when the sun came up‚Äù**


[27/03/2023 9:12 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I suggest getting ready to deal with it. Once we are set, I will light it on fire"**


[27/03/2023 11:06 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Looking at the webs that are 10 times his size... **"WOW.  That's a big web for sure!  And you have seen this before Mr. Hemmer?  That's amazing. Did they look just like the little spiders only a LOT bigger?"**


[27/03/2023 11:27 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Yes Phan, the first time we encountered them there were four webs like this close to each other. Yes they are huge."**


[29/03/2023 1:44 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Face full of awe and wonder. **"Wow, and you have made it back out, that's amazing. I'm actually even more excited to see them now than I was when the family fleeing said something about the big spiders.  This is so neat!"**


[29/03/2023 1:58 AM] WMDM
There is far less of the webbing than there was near the peanut or in the forest trapping the kangaroos and when the bonfire appears  the webbing quickly burns up.  The bushes around the webbing rustle as a large creature moves around in them out of sight.  The movement moves further away and eventually out of sight.  Only a few traces of the webbing remain in the trees.


[29/03/2023 2:05 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Watching the movement heading away. **"Well, that wasn't as action packed as I hoped.  Shall we continue on to the outpost? We should be there soon I think."**


[29/03/2023 4:04 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"They are back in the bushes. Keep a watch as we move closer to the outpost. "** shaking his head at Phan. **"I think your feline nature gets in the way of your monk training"**


[29/03/2023 5:48 AM] deamonlord
"It could have been one less fight when we get to the outpost. But it would be prudent to continue on."


[29/03/2023 9:48 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Could have been.  But it's on the other side of that stream, and we'd have had to cross it for you to be effective"**


[29/03/2023 9:48 AM] deamonlord
"Very true. Going to have to find a way to strike at a distance to be more helpful."


[30/03/2023 2:20 PM] deamonlord
"So, Phan was it? I'm curious: what monastery did you train out? Were you ever able to make it to the monk games?"


[31/03/2023 12:14 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Slowing a bit and walking next to Greg, **"Yes, My name is Phan Tasm.  Originally I was with my clan for a very short time in the High Forest.  They left the forest abandoning me there and I was found by a few monks and taken to an Monastery up there. That monastery is where we have been studying death.  We didn't go to any games as it wasn't aligned withour studies."**


[31/03/2023 5:10 AM] deamonlord
"Ah, that is fascinating. I was abandoned at a Kensei monastery. They were masters with weapons, I only managed a stick. Never got to go to them either, never was a good student. It's interesting to hear about the other traditions out there "


[31/03/2023 8:35 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Seems to be as many monasteries as there are temples'**


[1/04/2023 1:19 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan looks to hemmer. **"I've never really thought of it.  I know we have a few monasteries that are for those of us that study 'The Way of the Long Death', but I've never really thought about how many other traditions are studied. I guess there's more than one type of cleric since there are numerous deities, right?"**  Phan looks away and surveys the road trying to make sure we don't have any of those giant spiders sneaking around us.


[1/04/2023 2:48 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"some cities will have a dozen or more Temples all dedicated to a different deity.  Our traveling companion holds to a different god than I do. "**


[1/04/2023 8:20 PM] pender16
**‚ÄùYesssss‚Äù** Asper hisses in response **‚ÄùVhough vhat is more due to my heritage than my religion. It sssssseems as though we have different skillsssss too. On my ship I was primarily a medic‚Äù**


[2/04/2023 1:41 PM] WMDM
A few hours of uninterrupted travel pass, following the sketched map from Bandit.  It seems still accurate enough.  The landscape becomes more wild an untamed despite the relics of a ruined civilisation dotting the landscape.  Eventually the road you're travelling on widens and passes by a three storey building, twice as wide as it is tall, that seems to be a type of guard house to a fenced compound.   The structure is obviously from the old world, but repairs, extensions, and modifications have given it a more rustic appearance.  On either side of the building a tall wire fence extends out and then around the compound, the size of which is hard to judge from the front, but would easily hold a sizeable settlement.

The front door of the building is large and positioned in the direct centre and one of the two doors are currently wide open with no-one in sight.  There are a few side doors and windows, but they are all closed and look quite secure.


[3/04/2023 2:09 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer looks about not really seeing much, reaches over and touches Asper's shoulder muttering a prayer to help him


[7/04/2023 12:55 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Continuing to move closer to the open door **"hello?!"**


[7/04/2023 1:20 PM] WMDM
There is no response from the building, or anywhere else for that matter.  The door swings in the breeze and creaks a little which is the only sound you can hear.


[7/04/2023 2:03 PM] deamonlord
Greg walks over to one of the lower windows and peers inside. "This is creepy. Reminds me of the nights at the monastery."


[7/04/2023 2:13 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"the temple I came from was rarely quiet. There was always the sound of work being done. "** walking toward the door peering inside


[7/04/2023 9:27 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"Well, it's actually comforting to me for the quiet, however... we were warned about those giant spiders having shown up.  Do you think they are still here, or were those webs we saw the spiders moving on from this place once they found it empty?"** Phan tries to look around the fencing to see if there's anything that looks like spider webs or spider sacks. on the outside of the building.


[8/04/2023 12:51 AM] WMDM
Peering inside the windows Greg sees a small room with a cot and a books on the floor next to it.  There is a small chest with a set of simple clothes thrown over it.
Once Phan approaches the fence he gets a better view of the rest of the grounds.  It's quite large and it appears the some of the fences in the distance are covered in webbing.


[8/04/2023 12:53 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"Hey guys... there is webbing in the back.  And this place is huge. I could run around here for hours having fun getting exercise were it not for the threat of being eaten by a spider."** Phan chuckles at his own misguided humor.  **"So, do we want to look around inside or outside first?  If there's webbing back there, there's a chance for things to be caught in it."**


[8/04/2023 12:54 AM] WMDM
The fences all seem to be intact and have some sort of razor wire at the top presumably to prevent people climbing in, or possibly out.  It is looking fairly old though and you can see some places where the fences have been repaired.


[8/04/2023 12:57 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding **" In the past I have seen them store prey still alive in the webbing.  "**


[8/04/2023 1:06 AM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"OK, then we should try to get out there quicker just in case."** turning to Greg, **"And I know you are still young in the ways of monk fighting, so you may want to ease yourself into the fight.  Maybe let Hemmer and myself lead the way.  You could also peer around in here too while we take a precursory look out the other side of the building."**


[8/04/2023 6:22 AM] deamonlord
"I shall defer to the more experienced members here. I shall explore this room and meet back up with you." Greg moves into the door to get inside of the room.


[9/04/2023 9:27 AM] deamonlord
Greg sneaks into the room, wondering if there is a way through


[10/04/2023 9:53 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Seeing that Greg has vanished, Phan thinks it may be a good idea and decides to try to also carefully get further through the building and try to get out the back door to look around.  Though he does trip over something in the process, he still proceeds to the back of the gatehouse to try to see what can be seen.


[15/04/2023 2:14 PM] WMDM
Greg silently disappears into the building and Phan kicks a rock on the way in.  The entrance of the building looks much like the outside, old but in good repair considering the more primitive tools being used since it's original construction.  There is no signs of anything living yet but as you move through the building you see signs that it's been lived in recently.


[15/04/2023 2:20 PM] WMDM
As you explore the sprawling prison turned outpost, you come across several noteworthy areas on the ground floor. Towards the rear of the building, you spot a set of metal gates that appear to lead further into the complex. However, the mechanisms are jammed, preventing easy access.

Moving along, you notice a staircase that leads up to the second floor. The stairs look worn and precarious, raising concerns about their stability. Proceeding upwards might be risky.

You also come across a securely locked room just off the main hallway. There is an internal window, but it too is locked and covered with curtains, blocking your view of what lies beyond. The contents of the room remain a mystery, and gaining entry could prove challenging.


[17/04/2023 10:03 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan seeing the stairs decides it may be a good place to get a view outside of what they are working with and makes an attempt at climbing them, motioning the rest to stay back just in case. He whispers, **"Give the curious cat a moment. I want to see if I can get a better look outside to see what we may be walking into."**


[18/04/2023 12:03 AM] WMDM
Phan nimbly ascends the stairs.  About halfway up one of the stairs cracks under his weight but he catches himself before he loses balance and the rest seems sturdy enough.  At the top of the stairs a hallway stretches the length of the building with doors evenly spaced on either side.  Down one end of the hall the Tabaxi notes the tell tale signs of webbing.


[18/04/2023 10:36 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Looks down the stairs and speaks quietly but with purpose.  **"I see webbing up here too. We may not be alone inside this building.  I'm going to carefully slip down the hall and see if I can see anything more clear as there are a few doors up here too."**


[19/04/2023 3:04 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer pulls his shield around infront of him. Nodding to Phan. **"I'll wait here until I hear back from you"**


[20/04/2023 8:34 AM] WMDM
The doors are solid and as Phan investigates he finds the first one seems to be a type of common room.  There's a comfortable sofa and armchair, a small table and a bookshelf half filled with books.  There's a framed painting on the wall of a brightly coloured unicorn and a rough rug on the floor.


[20/04/2023 8:35 AM] WMDM
The next door along is has a desk with a chair and lantern, unlit, a small pile of papers and a bookshelf filled with knick knacks.  What looks like a map of the surrounding area is pinned to the wall.


[20/04/2023 8:36 AM] WMDM
The next room along has a bed with a quilted blanket, a wooden nightstand with a lantern and a book, a closet with a few items of clothing and shoes, and a framed portrait of a canine on the wall.


[20/04/2023 8:37 AM] WMDM
The fourth door has sturdy benches lining the walls and various tools scattered on top of them.  What looks like an unfinished wooden boat sits on the edge of the bench.


[20/04/2023 8:39 AM] WMDM
As Phan looks around the workshop, the unfinished wooden toy boat suddenly falls off the bench and crashes to the floor.  Behind it sits a Tiny spider.


[20/04/2023 12:35 PM] WMDM
After Phan disappears upstairs, everyone else hears a quiet crash from the second floor.


[20/04/2023 9:34 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Phan backs up out of the room and carefully begins making his way towards the stairs again keeping an eye towards the webbing at the end of the hall and the surrounding area.


[20/04/2023 11:15 PM] WMDM
The spider doesn't seem to react to you leaving.


[20/04/2023 11:23 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
Arriving back to the stairs. Phan quietly talks to Hemmer and the others. **"I don't see any signs of living people up here. I did see a tiny spider, but I have a feeling by the amount of webbing there may be more than just that.  Does anyone want to try to clear this building first or do we go straight to the back?  How about down there? Any sign of people in any of the rooms?"**


[25/04/2023 8:24 PM] deamonlord
"I will examine the rooms down here. Please, give me one moment? If you here screaming, I have probably found something."


[25/04/2023 8:28 PM] WMDM
The bottom floor is made up of mostly room that seem to have been converted to sleeping quarters.  Most are fairly sparse with the odd personal items, but other than that, not much of interest.  There is a stockroom on one end of the building, however it seems to be low on supplies and a bag of flour has been dropped on the floor, broken and left where it landed.  You also find the above mentioned locked office and jammed mechanisms.


[25/04/2023 8:44 PM] WMDM
Greg wedges his crowbar into the mechanism near the back.  The metal creaks as component to the large metal gate grate against each other.  It feels like it's going to give and with a final push...
The crowbar bends a little.  The mechanism has clearly been built to withstand the mere application of strength.


[25/04/2023 8:52 PM] deamonlord
Greg returns and recounts what he found, and shows his bent bar. "My apologies, I was unable to get into a locked room, my strength was no match for this strange building."


[25/04/2023 11:40 PM] Phan (Tabaxi Monk: Way of the Long Death)
**"I can try to pick the lock open if you want me to come down and try. Unless you have any other ideas. I'm kind of antsy up here with the idea of more spiders and being the only one up here."**


[26/04/2023 12:32 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Probably wise to try and clear the building, so at least we have a place to fall back to if there are too many out there.  Maybe I could make a key if it can't be picked".**


[26/04/2023 12:37 AM] Phan
**"That is sound advice.  Let me come down and see if I can assist with the locked door.  We can clear the bottom and work our way back up unless you would like to try to join me and clear any spiders on the top first."**


[26/04/2023 12:59 AM] Phan
Looking down the hall and then back to Hemmer. **"I know you said you dealt with spiders before.  What I saw down the hall was not a big spider but rather a tiny spider.  There's a decent amount of webbing as well. Too much for one tiny spider.  Have you dealt with any tiny spiders before, or just the big ones. I want to know what we may be getting ourselves into."**


[26/04/2023 1:01 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"it was the little ones that killed Hope.  They are the young and swarmed him"**


[26/04/2023 1:02 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Looking around.  **"the little ones seem to work as a team and overwhelm"**


[26/04/2023 1:07 AM] Phan
shuddering a little. **"Well, that decides it. I do NOT want to go alone to that area.  How about we clear the bottom first and we can revisit up here after.  There wasn't too much of note that I saw. Once I saw that tiny spider knock something off a table... I left and came back here."** Phan leaps down the steps (Monk slow-fall) landing beside Hemmer. **"OK, how about I try to pick the lock on this door here and we can decide where to go from here"**


[26/04/2023 1:12 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Looking around to see if there is another way around the locked door **"give it a try"**


[26/04/2023 1:23 AM] WMDM
The lock doesn't budge.  It's as if it was well designed to keep in prisoners or something, plus it's got fancy mechanisms that Phan is unfamiliar with.  Hemmer looks around the large metal frame and the surrounding rooms, but it seems like security has been kept tight and there is no way around.


[26/04/2023 1:45 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I have another thought on how to get through this, though it would render the lock useless in the future"**


[26/04/2023 2:07 AM] Phan
Phan knocks on the door. **"Is there anyone in there? This hallway is clear as is the road into town if you want to try to get away."**


[26/04/2023 2:15 AM] Phan
Turning his head to Hemmer. **"If no one comes to the door... I would say brute may be the only way to try to get in.  I didn't see any bodies but I also didn't inspect the webbing up there. The place was pretty empty. Though I didn't really go into rooms looking for keys or anything."**


[26/04/2023 10:47 PM] WMDM
The gate to the back of the complex looks something like this.

[26/04/2023 10:51 PM] WMDM
As Phan knocks on the door it swings open slightly.  It's as if he did manage to pick the lock but the universe took a minute to catch up.  There is however no response.


[26/04/2023 10:52 PM] Phan
Phan enters the room carefully only stepping a single step inside the door and looks around


[26/04/2023 11:22 PM] WMDM
Upon entering the room, you can't help but notice the stark contrast between the well-ordered office and the rest of the rundown outpost. The office is immaculate, with every quill and piece of parchment in its proper place.  In the center of the room stands a grand oak desk, polished to a shine. A small book is perfectly aligned with the edge of the desk next to a well-built wooden chair neatly tucked underneath.  The sense of order in the office is palpable, with every detail attended to and nothing out of place. The rest of the outpost may be in disarray, but within these walls, everything is meticulously maintained.  On the left wall an empty chalkboard shows vague remnants of past notes and drawings.  The opposite walls shows a large map of the complex and its surrounds with handwritten labels showing different locations.  The backwall is covered by shelving with many more books and a few shelves for food and drink.  A few oranges look mouldy and a bottle of something dark brown looks about half full, or empty depending on your perspective.


[26/04/2023 11:28 PM] Phan
Turning to Hemmer. **"It looks pretty amazing in here, and seems like this may be a good place to fall back to if we have any issues or feel overrun. Just need to see if there's anything in here that may help us get through the building."** Phan walks over to the desk and flips open the book quick to look at it as well as peeks around to see if there's anything else of use in there that my help with the gate mechanism or any other tools.


[27/04/2023 12:17 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Following Phan into the office **"Agreed. Someone was trying to control what they could in here"** starting to look around the office


[28/04/2023 6:47 AM] WMDM
The book seems to be a journal of the outpost.  The handwriting is cursive, each letter perfectly formed, and each entry is numbered.  It seems to be the personal thoughts of whoever was in charge and talks about issues that have come up and how they have tried to solve them.


[28/04/2023 12:21 PM] WMDM
The top drawer has a wooden tray with stationary neatly organised in every section.  The second drawer is filled with loose papers that look like inventories of stock and delivery schedules.  The bottom drawer is locked.


[28/04/2023 12:23 PM] Phan
Phan shakes the bottom drawer lightly making sure it's not just jammed, then reaches back into his pick for his pick set and tries to open it.


[28/04/2023 12:24 PM] jvanblaricom0001
looking through the papers, **"wow this was one anal individual"**


[28/04/2023 12:26 PM] Phan
**"I quite admire the mind though that can keep a rigid schedule and journal. Though it does question things about their personality and personal life. It seems like this job and this office were this person's life."**


[28/04/2023 3:15 PM] WMDM
The lock on the drawer seems a little to tricky for Phan to unlock.


[28/04/2023 10:57 PM] Phan
**"No luck on the drawer my way... keep looking around for keys or anything that may help us get through the gates in the back.  If we don't find anything here, I say we go upstairs."**


[28/04/2023 11:51 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"There is another option"** showing Phan his mace.


[1/05/2023 10:01 PM] Phan
**"Though I like that idea I also fear that idea not knowing what may be in here.  Before bashing, we should either look for a set of keys or try to pry it open with something else. Unfortunately I don't have any tools that would let me pry into something.  I do remember seeing a bedroom type room upstairs, Maybe this person stayed there and left some keys.  Shall we venture up and maybe deal with anything up there first?"**


[1/05/2023 10:04 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**It's as good a plan as any we have. I'll let you lead since you've been there once already"**


[1/05/2023 10:09 PM] Phan
Turning to the group. **"Alright, let's take a look upstairs.  The stairs are a bit shaky so be careful going up. I know there are some spiders up on the far side, so take it easy.  Maybe we can deal with them first to prevent any distractions while we search upstairs."**


[1/05/2023 10:17 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Makes sense. I might be able to mend some of those bad spots so we don't have to worry about them again"**


[2/05/2023 5:35 AM] Phan
**"Alright, lets get moving. Let me get to the top of the stairs and keep an eye out just incase something has changed in the last hour that we've been down here searching this room while you at least make the stairs suitable for our big friend over there.  And for our other serpentine friend as well."**


[3/05/2023 2:36 AM] Phan
Phan quickly leaps up the stairs again landing as soft and quiet as he can while looking to see if the spiders may have heard the raucous things happening downstairs in the office and the attempt at opening the gate. Hoping to prevent any soft of a surprise attack from the spiders and to maybe surprise them himself.


[3/05/2023 9:46 PM] WMDM
Now that the broken stairs have been pointed out it doesn't take long to mend the dodgy section and safely proceed upstairs where Phan is waiting.  For his own part Phan can hear skittering noises from inside the walls


[3/05/2023 10:09 PM] Phan
Phan turns to Hemmer and quietly says. **"If you listen closely, I think we have company close by... there's sounds of those tiny little legs skittering around in the walls. Let's get to the first room and search it quick.  It's just a basic common room but we never know if keys fell into the little couch or chair.  Or what may be on or around the table and bookshelf as well."**


[3/05/2023 10:22 PM] jvanblaricom0001
kneeling before the broken step and muttering a prayer.  Releasing the magic into it. He stands nods and makes sure his shield is settled on his arm


[3/05/2023 10:23 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer heads toward the room Phan was talking about, listening for the spiders


[4/05/2023 8:27 PM] WMDM
Searching under the sofa you find two silver and 3 copper coins (because losing coins under the sofa is universal and multi-dimensional) there is also, what looks like a page torn from a book and lots of dust.  There are no keys however.


[5/05/2023 3:23 AM] Phan
Turning to Hemmer.  **"I'm not finding much useful in this room.  What about you?  Think we should check the next room?"**


[5/05/2023 3:25 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding **"lets go, just keep an eye out"**


[5/05/2023 3:28 AM] Phan
Entering the next room, Phan sees another desk.  **"Well, gotta be done. Let's check that out see if there's anything in the drawers."**


[5/05/2023 3:29 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Walking in behind fan and starting to look around working over the room


[8/05/2023 5:10 PM] WMDM
The desk has very little in it.  There is a pencil with a broken tip which makes you wonder what it was broken on.  Looking around the room, you notice the map pinned to the wall has had some extra lines, arrows and words added to it recently.


[9/05/2023 1:41 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Walking over to the map and trying to understand the lines and and arrows.  **"what do you make of this?"**


[9/05/2023 2:16 AM] Phan
I see.. *achoo*  Let me take a ... *achoo*.  **"Not sure what's going on, but something is tickling my nose."**


[9/05/2023 5:14 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Might be the webs and dust in here. I never thought about it but might be your kind are just less okay with dust"** pointing out the additions to the map


[10/05/2023 6:38 AM] WMDM
The lines on the map are faint, but you can make out a few things.  The first thing is that the entire complex is a collection of buildings the seem to be connected by a series of walk ways.
Near the back a section is circled with a note *"Safest room"*.  Towards the middle of the complex a section of the walkway has a cross through it with the note.  *"Broken fence.  Needs repairs."*
Finally, near the bottom of the map are faint words which look like a book title *"Crocodile Hunter: The Life and Times of Steve Irwin"*


[10/05/2023 11:43 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Pointing out the "safest room". **"reckon if there is anyone alive this is where they will be holed up"**


[10/05/2023 11:18 PM] Phan
sniffling a bit as he recovers. **"I believe you are right. I'm betting we are going to have to fight our way there.  Just need to find a way to get out back to see if we can get to them.  Shall we continue to the next room and see what we find there?"**


[11/05/2023 12:02 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding **"yes lets keep moving"** looking around to **"any idea where the others are?"**


[11/05/2023 5:13 PM] WMDM
The pair search the rest of the rooms and find nothing new or exciting.  The last one is the workshop where phan last saw the tiny spider.


[11/05/2023 9:50 PM] Phan
Phan points to the last door and looks to Hemmer.  **"That's where I saw that spider that knocked over the toy.  Do we dare quickly venturing in to clear this room and make sure all windows/entrances are closed just in case we need a safe place to fall back and rest?"**


[12/05/2023 12:06 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Yes lets clear this room, and check through it for anything that might prove useful'**


[12/05/2023 12:06 AM] Phan
**"Alright.  I'm ready, I'll head in first and then you follow close behind."** Phan enters the room and begins looking for spiders that need to be squished.


[12/05/2023 12:19 AM] jvanblaricom0001
nodding as he pulls the mace from his hip, **"lets do this"**


[16/05/2023 12:01 AM] WMDM
As you step into the room again you notice a shadow on the wall that wasn't there before.  Then the shadow moves towards you and you realise it's a swarm of tiny spiders.  More spiders start swarming out of the cracks in the walls, out of the ceiling and up through the floorboard and within seconds the entire floor is a sea of tiny arachnids approaching you fast.


[16/05/2023 1:37 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer mutters a spell and sends a burst of light at the oncoming swarms. It seems to have no effect on most of them.


[16/05/2023 4:16 AM] Phan
Phan takes his spear and swipes through taking out some of the closest swarm. He quickly follows it up with two swipes of his claws dispatching the first swarm and thinking out the second swarm.


[16/05/2023 9:12 AM] WMDM
Two of the swarms approach Hemmer, one of them climbing up his legs, the other swarm scuttling towards Phan.


[16/05/2023 9:22 AM] Phan
Phan takes a few more good swings at the approaching swarm. **"I can see why you weren't antsy about these when I mentioned the tiny spider earlier."**


[16/05/2023 12:42 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer swings his mace at a swarm and then calls forth a glowing hammer to swing again missing both times


[16/05/2023 12:42 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Yea they aren't fun"**


[16/05/2023 10:58 PM] WMDM
The spider's swarm and try to climb Hemmer and Phan but are unable to bite them through the armour and quick moves.


[16/05/2023 11:03 PM] Phan
Phan takes a quick swipe again with his spear at the remaining spiders crawling towards him and quickly kicks out at the spiders that are beginning to cover Hemmer.


[16/05/2023 11:59 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer lashes out with the glowing hammer of faith, missing.  Then brings his mace to bear on the swarm.


[17/05/2023 6:40 AM] WMDM
As Hemmer bends to smash the critter scurrying around him the rest of the swarm milling around leap and crawl onto his arm and into his armour biting and crawl everywhere.


[17/05/2023 6:59 AM] Phan
Phan seeing the pain woot on Hemmer's face jumps in with another quick stab and kick still not quite dispatching all of the 3rd swarm.


[17/05/2023 12:59 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer cries out in pain and then calls, then casts a spells to heal himself.


[17/05/2023 5:49 PM] jameshurburgh
Started a thread.


[17/05/2023 7:55 PM] Phan
Phan continues his attacks on the swarms  taking down another and helping try to get the swarms off Hemmer.


[17/05/2023 10:52 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer uses a swipe of his mace to line the spiders up before crushing a portion of the swarm with the spiritual weapon


[17/05/2023 11:11 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Looking over at Phan **" I tried to warn you about these vile creatures"**


[17/05/2023 11:14 PM] Phan
Phan kills off the last of the swarm on Hemmer and says, **"I see what you are talking about.  You look rough.  Let's check this room quick and see if we can find anything of use here.  Maybe go to the office downstairs and take a short rest so you can heal up a bit.  Sound good to you?"**


[17/05/2023 11:15 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Hello?  Anyone there?"** Dhan'ya's voice comes from downstairs.


[17/05/2023 11:15 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**I have felt better after a fight,"** searching the room to find anything of use **"


[17/05/2023 11:17 PM] Phan
Phan's ears perk up at the sound of a new voice. **"Umm, hello there.  Yes, we are upstairs the far back room. It appears to be safe in the building now.  We just took down a bunch of tiny spiders.  You can either wait down there for us in that office or you can come up here."**


[17/05/2023 11:18 PM] WMDM
The pair of you find a number of useful tools that would be suitable for bending or working metal wire.


[17/05/2023 11:24 PM] Phan
Looking to Hemmer.  **"Also, do you think you can try to see if you can mend some of these small cracks in the walls that the spiders were getting through?  Maybe we can close this building off to help prevent more swarms getting in here."**


[17/05/2023 11:26 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding, **"that's a really good plan. This looks like it could be used to repair fencing."**


[17/05/2023 11:26 PM] jvanblaricom0001
settling in and casting mend over the various cracks in the walls


[17/05/2023 11:27 PM] Phan
**"Yeah, I think with your talents that you can benefit most from these tools.  Keep them and maybe you can do something about the gatework downstairs too."**


[18/05/2023 5:30 PM] WMDM
Steve and Dhan'ya enter the foyer and start looking around.  Phan's voice floats down from upstairs.


[18/05/2023 5:31 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Oh I'm so sorry Steve.  I didn't introduce myself.  Dhan'ya.  Just Dhan'ya."**


[18/05/2023 5:39 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"That's OK it's a pleasure to meet you dhan'ya, is one of you fine adventurous hammer?"** steve walks into the room and looks around


[18/05/2023 5:39 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I think we should all take a quick rest. What's been happening here? Have you found anything?"**


[18/05/2023 7:53 PM] Phan
Phan enters the office where the others are waiting. **"Well met and welcome. We had some other adventures with is but they decided it was best to escort people back to town. We've just cleared the upstairs area of a few swarms of spiders. Didn't really find much else up there. This room here is the cleanest and safest. Upstairs we did see a map that had a bit of information about this place as well as some notes on it about an area that needs the fence repaired. There's a gate area here that has been jammed up that one of the others that left tried to get through but couldn't. We really haven't been that far yet into the compound. The only thing of note in this room is there is a locked drawer in the desk that I couldn't open"** Phan pulls his lock picks out and puts them back in his pocket. **"Didn't find any keys upstairs either. I believe the place to be safe if you both want to inspect it for anything. Or we could see about processing further into the compound. Hemmer needs a few to recover as those swarms did a number on him upstairs."**


[18/05/2023 8:06 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I'm steve, we came from town just after another spider attack, there were 2 huge f......forest spiders and other giant ones, have you come across anything like that here?"** steve has a look around but doesn't feel he would do any better at the lock, **"take your time these spiders are not of anything I have ever seen"**


[19/05/2023 12:01 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**Im Hemmer"** looking at Steve.  **"there was an attack on the town? We haven't seen any of the large ones yet.  Though I'd bet money there here"**


[19/05/2023 12:03 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I belive we kept them out of the town, and there were no casualties in the attack party"**


[19/05/2023 12:34 AM] Phan
**"Agreed that I'm sure we will see those things here. That's a lot of webbing out there for these tiny things we just dealt with.  Plus we did see a glimpse of them on the road here. I wonder if that set was headed towards the town."** Phan looks back to Steve. **"Thanks for the news. It's definitely good to know that we have plenty of adventurers to help protect the town. Wonderous news that there were no casualties."**


[19/05/2023 12:38 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**" there are still plenty and able there. I'm troubled as to why they have come tho so I have come here to help you. Your friend Sergio spoke highly of you hemmer"**


[19/05/2023 6:56 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Yes Steve la Flure and the others did wonderfully and thank the gods no-one was hurt too much.  There was talk of the spiders being driven?  Is that the right word?  Acting unnaturally.  I'm not sure I could tell the difference but have you seen anything unnatural here?"** Dhan'ya asks with concern.


[19/05/2023 7:01 AM] Phan
**"Other than seeing everyone abandoning this place and being swarmed with spiders, nothing really unnatural yet. Things from their world that are different than ours, but we've been seeing that in town too. "**


[19/05/2023 7:03 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The aasimar nods in agreement.  **"Well I might have a poke around while you're taking a rest if that's ok.  You said the building should be safe?  Steve are you going to take a look as well?"**


[19/05/2023 7:31 AM] Phan
**"Yeah, I am fairly certain we took care of all the swarms inside and Hemmer tried to mend the walls upstairs a bit to hopefully keep them out. There's a map with looking at of the compound. Other than that not a lot from the first inspection."**


[19/05/2023 2:25 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"could you take the map or is it on a wall or something?"**


[19/05/2023 2:35 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"It was just pinned to the wall.  I'm sure we could go get it."**


[19/05/2023 4:57 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"do we think we need it? We're any areas marked as off limits or restricted?"**


[19/05/2023 4:59 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Hmmmm.  I don't remember.  I'll go get it."** she says with a smile and returns a minute later with the map.


[19/05/2023 10:23 PM] Phan
Phan clears the desktop off so Dhan'ya can lay it out so everyone can get another look at it. **"I guess the first thing we should do is get out back of this building and see if we can get more figured out about what's going on here. What do you think Dhan'ya? Think we can do this safely?"**


[20/05/2023 11:31 AM] jameshurburgh (pinned)

[20/05/2023 11:33 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"I'm sure that if we work together we'll be able to overcome any obstacle this place can throw at us, but I think you're right.  We need to get through that gate.  I took a look and it's stuck tight.  I think we need to take a closer look at why it's jammed or find another way to get through."**


[20/05/2023 12:00 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I could theoretically melt the metal of the lock.  Id would be useless afterwards though. If I knew the actual problem I could try to mend it if the lock is actually broken"**


[20/05/2023 12:04 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"I don't know much about locks and metal and things.  I'm sure whatever you think is the best option will be fine Hemmer."** Dhan'ya says with a smile.


[20/05/2023 11:01 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I have nothing of use unless I throw my self at the gate and hope it breaks"**


[21/05/2023 12:45 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Well I could magically step past it myself, but that wouldn't help the rest of you.  Do you think it was jammed on purpose or broken?  Perhaps I could look at it from the other side.  What do you think?"**


[21/05/2023 3:35 AM] Phan
**"We also just got some tools upstairs. Maybe Hemmer could try to unjam the locking mechanism"**


[21/05/2023 10:04 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Sounds good.  Should we have a look then?"** Dhan'ya asks picking up the map and starting for the door.


[22/05/2023 10:00 PM] Phan
Phan nods and stands back up feeling rested.  **"It is pleasant having you both here.  Let us see what we can do about these gates and hopefully find out what is going on with all these webs we are seeing here.  When you see this gate, you will see why we haven't made it far.  But on the bright side, we have secured this building."**


[22/05/2023 11:32 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Let me look at it and see what I can do. I'd rather not melt it if I dont have to since it would make it useless going forward. These people have a level of technology that  in some things is beyond us"**


[22/05/2023 11:46 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"They are quite the different people, we could learn alot from them"**


[23/05/2023 10:17 PM] Phan
Phan nods to Hemmer. **"I know Greg had tried something before he had to leave.  Hopefully it didn't do anything too bad.  Maybe he got something back in place or loosened something to make it a little easier to attempt to fix/mend. Maybe once it's unjammed if we still can't open it I can attempt to unlock it maybe."** Turning to Steve. **"I think you're right. I think there are things we an learn from them. Just as they could learn from us,  Especially if we find there is no way to help return them to their original world"**


[23/05/2023 10:27 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Let's go then!"** She says with a skip in her step and heads down to the gate.  Once she gets the she gives it a useless wiggle and stands back disappointed, then huffs.  **"Well let's take a look from the other side then."** she says indignantly.


[23/05/2023 10:29 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
With a brief incantation Dhan'ya is surrounded by a silvery mist and as she takes a step towards the gate, suddenly appears on the other side.


[23/05/2023 10:33 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"hopefully its as easy as that"** steve chuckles **"stay close to the gate we cant help you from here if anything happens"**


[23/05/2023 10:34 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya chuckles.  **"Ah ha.  I've just realised.  I can only do that once before I have a rest, so this had better work."** She says nervously.


[23/05/2023 10:38 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Ok, I can see something in here.  It seems to be stuck.  Like.  All the metal is interlocked so that it can't move.  Does that help at all?"** Dhan'ya says screwing up her face in confusion.


[23/05/2023 10:39 PM] WMDM
With his nimble paws, Phan is able to find where the lock has been jammed and it seems as if an extra piece of metal has been put in there to keep it closed.


[23/05/2023 10:43 PM] WMDM
Phan easily wiggles the metal out of place and quickly pull back his paw before the mechanism closes when the jammed metal was.  The lock loosens and the door swings freely on it's hinges.


[23/05/2023 10:55 PM] Phan
**"Well hey, look at that. Now if only that drawer would have opened this easily.  My curiosity still has me wondering what is in that locked drawer."** Giving everyone a moment to chuckle at the thought of the curiosity and the cat.


[24/05/2023 12:20 AM] jvanblaricom0001
laughing. **"We will get into that drawer. Well done getting that door open."** shaking his head at how easy Phan made that look


[24/05/2023 6:48 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Oh wonderful.  I'm glad not to be stuck on this side by myself.  Ok.  Are we going to open the drawer or go further into this complex?  What's in the drawer that we need anyway?"** Dhan'ya asks curiously.


[24/05/2023 8:16 AM] Phan
Phan laughs. **"Well, useful or needed? No idea. It's just a locked drawer and I'm curious to see what is in it. But I'm all for going forward too."**


[25/05/2023 3:18 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"maybe as we travel through we will find something of use"** steve walks through the gate with everyone else and looks for signs of life or if anything had been through there recently


[25/05/2023 10:25 PM] WMDM
As the party continue through the gate they exit the building into an enclosed walkway.  Surrounded on both sides by thick crisscrossed wire fencing and covered by a steel framed roof that seems to have been patched and repaired many times with wood and whatever other materials lay about.  The walkway is around 20 feet wide and you can see it branches left and right in 120 feet.


[25/05/2023 11:10 PM] Phan
Phan looks back to the map that Dhan'ya has and decides to speak up. **"If we want to look for survivors, there's that room titled safe that may be there. However... if we want to see about making sure we don't have something coming at us from behind I would recommend we go see what we may be able to do about the broken fencing to the right. My vote is go to the right first and check those buildings and walkways."**


[25/05/2023 11:13 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I think your right. this could be a hard enough fight if the survivors are safe in that room already I think they should stay there until we know the rest of the compound is safe,"** Steve looks around to see if there is any more sheets of timber or anything around to board up the fence **"You said there were tools we could use to repair this chain link?"**


[26/05/2023 6:38 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The little aasimar's brows furrow **"Both ideas are good.  I am keen to make sure the people are ok, but it does make sense to make sure the area is secure.  You've got those tools don't you Hemmer?  How long do you think it will take to  repair the fence?"** she asks looking to Hemmer expectantly.


[26/05/2023 6:43 AM] WMDM
Phan notices patches of the grass outside the secure walkway crawling with tiny spiders.  Off near the back of the compound more webbing stretches from the ground to the fence, to the buildings, to the trees.  The webs themselves aren't without movement and indeed he spots a Medium spider casually walking the grounds of the complex outside the secure fence.


[27/05/2023 12:10 AM] Phan
Phan looks around and starts briefly remembering the swarm in the building they just left. **"Just as a heads-up lady and gents, there are some more of those tiny swarms of spiders over there, there, there and there with possibly more unseen.  And if you look there, there is a bigger spider walking.  I would definitely recommend we try to secure that broken section if possible. I don't think this fencing can stop the swarms of tiny getting in, but if there's a big enough gap, we could find ourselves surrounded by swarms and big spiders up in this walkway.  Not sure I want to see that happen."** And with that, Phan makes the choice for the group hoping they follow and heads to the right towards the broken fencing, albeit as quiet and safe as he can.


[28/05/2023 12:03 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya nods in agreement and follows Phan quietly.


[28/05/2023 9:08 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve starts to follow, **"maybe we should hold a bit of a gap between us, have 2 of us go and fix the fence and the others keep watch and support the rear so we don't get cut off?"**


[28/05/2023 9:57 AM] Phan
Phan slows down a little and looks to Steve. **"It's always good to be on guard, but with the number of spiders, I think it would be best if we stayed closer together. It's not a bad idea to have someone watching our backs while someone watches ahead. I'll work to protect Hemmer and assist in whatever way I can if you two want to watch us and the path behind. The sooner and safer we get the fence taken care of, the sooner we get to check the safe building"**


[28/05/2023 10:57 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"can do, have you notice if anything spokes them more than anything else?"**


[29/05/2023 11:25 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Shaking his head out. **" Um I don't know. I guess an hour or so, I've never quite fixed a fence like this.  Maybe if one of you can use the tool and wire while I cast Mend on parts of it, it will go quicker. "**


[30/05/2023 12:23 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I'll try it, phan how about you stay ahead and keep watch ahead and dhan'ya you keep an eye out what behind us"**


[30/05/2023 12:49 AM] Phan
**"I will definitely keep an eye towards the spiders. I've been trying to not let that bigger spider out of my sight."**


[30/05/2023 12:59 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"noticing any kinds of patters or odd behaviour yet?"**


[30/05/2023 9:25 PM] Phan
**"Well, they seem to be acting like spiders to me. Not sure that I would know what an odd behavior would be for them.  I'm hoping we have enough time to fix that fence though before any other surprises show up."**


[30/05/2023 10:42 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer sets to work using the wire and tools to start closing the gap from the top down


[30/05/2023 10:44 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve goes and helps him holding the fence together while hemmer ties the chains together


[31/05/2023 9:55 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya nods and keeps an eye out where they've come from.


[31/05/2023 11:18 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Whispering to hemmer **"you can do it"** in a Rob Schneider kinda voice


[31/05/2023 11:20 PM] jvanblaricom0001
** " I think this tool is steel, and the handle looks like oak.  What does Yew have to do with it?"** not even looking up as he keeps working


[31/05/2023 11:22 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"sorry I'll leave the professionals to the work"** steve just tucks away behind waiting for his next lot of instructions


[31/05/2023 11:41 PM] WMDM
It doesn't take Hemmer long to assess the issue.  The wiring the fence is made of  is connected along various point and one of the connection has broken so both side of the fence have retracted back.  In the toolkit he picked up it looks like they have just the tool to pull them back towards each other.  You'll just need to find something to make them hold once they're together.  The hole is probably six feet wide.  As Hemmer is pulling the second side of the fence wiring to attach it to the tool a piece of metal dislodges from somewhere above and comes crashing down on the outside of the fence.
Phan's keen eyes see the large spider take notice... Then move closer.


[31/05/2023 11:45 PM] Phan
**"Well, that was less than stellar, but I'm here I will do everything I can to stop anything from happening to you while you do this."**


[1/06/2023 12:50 AM] WMDM
A flurry of spiders, attracted to the noise scurry closer and make it just outside the fence.


[2/06/2023 7:09 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The small aasimar flings magical missiles at the three swarms outside the fence strikeing them squarely.


[2/06/2023 9:31 AM] Phan
leaping through the fence, Phan takes a quick swing with his spear followed by 2 swipes with his claws at the closest swarm. **"Keep working on that fence! I'll do my best to keep them out here and jump back through once you are ready to seal it closed!"**


[3/06/2023 12:05 AM] WMDM
The swarms surge forward, two of them crawling through the fence and surrounding Dhan'ya and Steve.  Meanwhile a third of the spiders crawl all over phan, one of them climbing the fence then launching itself onto his face and sinking it's pincers deep.


[3/06/2023 12:08 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Seeing the spiders covering Phan, Dhan'ya unleashing force missiles at the swarm, knocking them all off him and leaving them dead on the floor.


[3/06/2023 12:47 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer takes a brief break from the fence to call forth the spiritual Hammer and attack one of the swarms.  He keeps working as best he can pausing only to crush more of the swarm


[3/06/2023 8:25 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve takes a quick draw and shot towards the second swarm of spiders, the arrow just slides along the fence and doesn't quite penetraite through


[3/06/2023 9:59 PM] Phan
Phan seeing the spiders beginning to harrow the others after Dhan'ya kills of the swarm on him jumps back through turns quickly and takes out the remnants of the next swarm. Then quickly jumps back into the fence area and starts swiping at the third swarm.


[4/06/2023 1:31 AM] WMDM
The Giant Wolf Spider follows Phan through the gap in the fence and sinks it's teeth into him again.
Meanwhile, from around the corner of the building to the north, two more spiders appear and begin scurrying closer.
The tiny spider's surrounding Steve manage to bite him a few times causing a little damage.


[4/06/2023 1:36 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Ahh.  Looks like there might be some more spiders on the way Hemmer.  What do we need to do to get this closed up?"** Dhan'ya says after finishing off the swarm around Steve and hitting the wolf spider with a bolt that crumpled it like tissue paper.  **"Hmmm.  If they're all this weak we shouldn't have too much trouble."**


[4/06/2023 1:45 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer continues working to close up the fence, meanwhile he sends the glowing hammer into the face of the giant spider.  **"trust me they don't all go down that easy"**


[4/06/2023 2:31 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve quickly casts hunters mark on the spider as it climbs through the fence then sends an arrow through its head


[4/06/2023 2:36 PM] Phan
Phan once again jumps through the fence seeing another spider heading for the opening and with a quick stab of his doorway and a perfect sweep with his claws he makes easy work of the spider. Quickly he jumps in offering whatever help he can to Hemmer to fix the fence quickly.


[4/06/2023 9:40 PM] WMDM
Even as the two new spider's crumble into a heap, five more appear crawling over the nearby buildings and approaching fast.


[4/06/2023 9:43 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Why are you going out where the spiders are?"** Dhan'ya says frantically to Phan as she casts another spell and brings a flurry of snow balls done crashing down on three of the new spiders.  **"I'll be out of spells soon!"**


[5/06/2023 12:02 AM] jvanblaricom0001
As Hemmer continues to struggle pulling at the fence he sends his hammer into the face of another of the giant spiders


[5/06/2023 10:11 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve sends another arrow into a spiders face, **"hope not to many more of these big guys show up"**


[7/06/2023 2:38 AM] Phan
Phan quickly stabs at the injured spider and quickly jumps back through the fence assuming a position ready to attack again should they come near or more show up.


[7/06/2023 11:58 AM] WMDM
Another of the spiders takes a bite at Phan missing him and as he looks up sees two Giant Spiders crawl over the nearby building and into range.


[7/06/2023 12:02 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Uh those ones look nastier.  How's that fence coming along?"**


[7/06/2023 11:55 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Pulling the fence tighter, **"getting there"** Hemmer sends the hammer at one of the spiders missing it.


[8/06/2023 9:26 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
With the little frustration of more spiders showing up he pulls a little harder on his bow string and sends the arrow straight through the last of the giant wolf spiders **"where are they still comming from"**


[8/06/2023 9:24 PM] Phan
Phan seeing the smaller spiders all down and the giant spiders approaching quickly grabs a bit more of the fence to help Hemmer close the rest of it leaving the caster and the person with a bow to gems of the others. **"I'll help here, can you both please keep attacking at range?"**


[8/06/2023 9:25 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I'll do my best"**


[8/06/2023 9:52 PM] WMDM
The giant spiders both shoot their webs at Phan one of them sticking his paws to the fence.


[8/06/2023 11:13 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Ha.  Sure thing Phan.  Just running a little low on spells is all."** Dhan'ya says nervously firing off another few missiles at the approaching arachnids.


[9/06/2023 12:28 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer continues to try and work the fence back together, pulling against the added weight of Phan doesn't seem to be making it easier.  He once again sends the floating hammer into a spider smacking it solidly


[9/06/2023 8:51 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve still frustrated with constant spiders hastily takes another shot and misses "I'll try my best but with shots like that"


[9/06/2023 8:29 PM] Phan
Phan seeing his paws get webbed decides to see if that will help him hold the fence better for Hemmer. **"One more try and this should be good. They are least will have a harder time getting more than me. Let's get this done!'**


[9/06/2023 10:28 PM] WMDM
The giant spider lurches forward throwing itself at the fence bodily, trying to find a way in.


[9/06/2023 10:39 PM] WMDM
Slamming into the hole in the fence the first spider strains the hold Hemmer has on the wiring and he can feel the pressure increasing.  Meanwhile the second spider hits at the fence with it's legs uselessly.


[9/06/2023 10:43 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"May the gods bless this man and his mighty muscles that he may keep these creepy crawlies outside where they belong!"** Dhan'ya says voice quivering.


[10/06/2023 9:06 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer pulls the fence together with an unknown strength, and pushes the handle of his mace through the links.


[11/06/2023 1:35 AM] WMDM
As the first of the giant spiders falls and the fence closes, the second one seems to lose interest in immediately getting through and retreats a little, seeming ro watch to see what you'll do next.


[11/06/2023 1:40 AM] Phan
**"Well, that was an adventure for sure. Nice work on that fence Hemmer. Let us head to that safe room quick and see if there are any people that need help, shall we?"**


[11/06/2023 1:42 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Maybe we should just make sure this is back to new first?  I know the mending cantrip which should seal it nicely."** The petite aasimar begin reciting incantations over a section of the broken fence.


[11/06/2023 6:24 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer nods and starts casting the same spell toward the top of the break


[11/06/2023 7:29 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"after that we can check these other buildings"**


[11/06/2023 11:43 PM] Phan
**"We should look in these other buildings for sure, but my question for the help is should we take a rest in that office or look in the safe room first before these others? Our caster friend here looks pretty spent. I could use an hour test but I'm fine doing whatever we need to do."**


[12/06/2023 12:42 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" No reason not to take a bit of a break if it will help our odds of survival.  Anyone still here doesn't know we are coming to help, so the extra time will not cause them any anxiety"**


[12/06/2023 12:43 AM] WMDM
After a few casts of mending, the gap in fence has completely disappeared.  The Giant Spider outside hasn't left yet though and watches the group intently.


[12/06/2023 12:44 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Just don't make the spider angry until we're done here maybe?"** Dhan'ya cautions as she continues weaving the fence back together mystically.  **"Phew.  Well I could do with a rest that's for sure.  I haven't cast that many spells at once since the attack on the city.  That spider is still creeping me out a bit as well but it's nice to have something more secure between us and it."**


[13/06/2023 8:35 AM] WMDM
The spider ignores the various projectiles the group is disposing of through the fence and keeps watching.


[13/06/2023 8:37 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Ok.  So ahh.  Does this one need to die to?  I know it's creepy, but it's not hurting anyone right now.  Are we going to keep going or finish it off?"**


[13/06/2023 8:59 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"as long as it just keeps watching I guess, but I would hate for it to break through when we're trying to return through here"**


[13/06/2023 9:34 PM] Phan
Looking at the fence point that was just mended. **"I don't think we need to worry about it breaking through, at least at that spot. You both did a great job.  Thank you for your work. Do we want to enter this building at the end, or not risk it due to possibility of more spiders? As I see you are very tired, it has been a long day already. We can go back to the office area and shut ourselves in there and take a nice rest to recouperate, or we can venture to the building that was marked safe on that map and see what's there. I leave the choice to you that need to recover more. I am just lightly scratched from those bites but could at least use an hour to recover completely.  Or I can definitely also keep watch for part of the longer rest if you need it."**


[14/06/2023 7:05 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"I could do with a breather, that's true.  I *could* push on but I'm not sure how much used I'd be without a good rest unfortunately."**


[15/06/2023 1:38 AM] Phan
Phan looks to Hemmer and Steve. **"What say you both? Shall we find a place to bed down a bit and recuperate or push forward and start checking the buildings nearby? I could use an hour but I can also push on as well."**


[15/06/2023 3:56 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**'A short break will be best I think, as we don't know what to expect in there"**


[15/06/2023 10:51 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" a short break now may be the difference between life and death later.  I'd rather not lose another companion to spiders"**


[15/06/2023 10:53 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Great.  Back to the office it is then?"** Dhan'ya says and starts back that way then waits to see if the others are coming.


[15/06/2023 10:55 PM] Phan
Phan nods in agreement and begins to follow. **"Sounds good to me."**


[15/06/2023 10:55 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" it would be a good place to hole up. "** following along with the others


[15/06/2023 10:57 PM] WMDM
The short walk back to the office is uneventful and the place is as it was left.


[15/06/2023 10:57 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Well that was the most action I've seen for a while."** The aasimar says as she settles down on something comfortable.


[15/06/2023 10:58 PM] Phan
**"That was definitely a crazy run with those spiders. 3 different sizes.  Much different than fighting those tiny spider swarms we found in this building."**


[15/06/2023 11:02 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Settling in and taking his leg off.  **" the last time it was all of them at the same time, and no fence to keep them at bay"**


[16/06/2023 6:41 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Oh that must have been dreadful.  Was that... Was that when Hope died?  I didn't know him well but he seemed like a good Tiefling."**


[17/06/2023 1:57 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"yes that was the time. He was. good man.  "**


[17/06/2023 2:34 AM] Phan
**"Kitty curiosity getting the best of me. Those bigger spiders we saw today, that was as big as they get, right? Or am I in for more surprises?"** Phan looks to Dhan'ya and Hemmer.


[17/06/2023 9:25 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Smiling slightly **" I don't know. The first time I fought them with Hope and Sergio the seemed smaller, the day we lost Hope, even the little ones seemed bigger, and the big ones seemed insurmountable. But all that could be fear and adrenaline clouding things"**


[18/06/2023 8:33 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"The were two absolutely HUGE spiders that attacked the city.  I haven't seen anything that big here yet though, thank the gods."**  She settles down comfortably and soon starts snoring softly.


[20/06/2023 4:09 AM] Phan
Phan looks to the now sleeping Dhan'ya.  **"Hmmm... well.  I guess there's no harm in sleeping for a while.  But huge spiders?  I know I shouldn't want to see them... but I REALLY want to see them.  I can hope we don't of course... but this is something absolutely amazing."** Phan sits and begins meditating on everything that has happened.  After a little over an hour has passed, he carefully wakes Dhan'ya. **"I see you are super tired and might need a longer rest. If you feel it necessary, I don't see an issue with us spending a little more time here. I'm very curious to see if there is anyone in that safe room, but if it is as safe as the map may lead us to believe, I think we should be OK letting you get your rest."** Phan pauses and looks to the group. **"Well, come to think of it... are we sure it is a safe place to stay? I mean it could just be where they keep all the important things locked away for safe keeping. Hmmm."** Pondering on that he looks to the group for input.


[21/06/2023 7:50 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Huh.  Oh sorry.  Umm.  Yes I could do with a longer rest, but I don't want to hold you up either.  You decide.  Hemmer, Steve?  What do you think?  I am keen to find the poor people that are missing, hopefully still in one piece."**


[21/06/2023 8:06 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I understand the need of rest, will more rest return more of your energy for spell casting? "** sliding the prosthetic leg back into place


[21/06/2023 10:17 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Sure will.  Sorry.  I've not been under this kind of pressure before with people depending on me."**


[21/06/2023 10:40 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"would another hour suffice or will you require more than that?"**


[21/06/2023 12:09 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Uh.  I think I'd need a good night's rest actually.  No no.  It's ok.  Let's press on now.  These people need our help."**


[23/06/2023 4:16 AM] Phan
Phan nods to Dhan'ya.  **"Alright, if you feel you are ready enough, let us head out to that building marked safe and see if we can help anyone there."**


[23/06/2023 6:59 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Sounds good.  Let's get going then."** Dhan'ya says, standing.


[23/06/2023 7:04 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"let's hope anyone in there is OK, and not more hostile."** steve gathers his stuff and gets himself ready, **" I don't think this place would be big enough for any of those huge f..forest spiders he fought at the gates"**


[23/06/2023 11:11 PM] Phan
Phan stands up and stretches to loosen up again and then heads out into the hallway.  **"I'm thinking we should still try to not draw attention to us when we are in the fenced in area.  Those tiny spiders don't need a hole in the fence to get through.  I'll lead the way again if you would like.  And I do recommend we try to be stealthy if at all possible."** Looking to Hemmer.  **"You want to follow up the rear of the group and watch our backs? I think it would be best to keep our new members in the center just in case."**


[24/06/2023 12:29 AM] jameshurburgh
Pinned a message.


[24/06/2023 12:30 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
As they get to the gate Dhan'ya pulls out the map again and offers it for the others to see.  **"Are we going to make sure these other buildings are secure?  Or just head straight for the safe room at the end?"**


[24/06/2023 12:34 AM] Phan
Phan pauses looking at Dhan'ya thoughtfully.  **"You make another good point about checking the buildings in that being a good idea to prevent possible surprises from showing up behind us.  We have 2 to the right that we can check after we finish checking the safe building.  But that building right there straight to our left is a good place to start"** Phan looks up from the map and to the left down the walkway at the building and nods.


[24/06/2023 12:47 AM] Phan
**"That is, unless you want to check those other two before. I just figured it would be best to go left first."**


[24/06/2023 12:49 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Taking rear guard makes sense.  As does checking the buildings along the way.  Lets go left, I trust your instincts Phan."**


[24/06/2023 12:57 AM] WMDM
As the party makes their way down the left hand path Dhan'ya and Hemmer spot movement around the fences at the edge of the compound.  Spiders climbing through webs perhaps?  It's hard to tell.  Thankfully, despite Steve missing the first turn and crashing into the fence, it seems none of the spiders are nearby.  The door at the end of the walkway opens when you try it and inside is a small reception area.  On the right hand side of the room, behind a counter protected by a thick iron bars is a small office space with a closed back door.  Another door is set into the middle of the left wall and apart from some hard uncomfortable looking seating the room is empty.


[24/06/2023 5:51 AM] Phan
*quietly* **"I'm going to call out. Just in case there's something in here, be at the ready.  Maybe stick near the door to start."** Phan then turns into the room looking for signs of anyone that may be there. **"Hello, we are here to help.  Is there anyone else here?"**


[24/06/2023 10:36 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer pulls his shield up into a ready position while he holds his mace  awaiting anything that could harm them.


[26/06/2023 9:30 PM] Phan
looking to the others says. **"I'm thinking we check the office area first before peaking out that other door."**


[27/06/2023 11:57 PM] WMDM
Behind the bars the office space seems fairly sparse of anything interesting.  A few desks and chair seem to have bee largely ignored and left to collect dust and any paperwork has long since deteriorated.


[27/06/2023 11:59 PM] WMDM
A faint shuffling sound can be heard behind the door before a frail voice can be heard.  **"Is someone there?  I think someone is there."**


[28/06/2023 12:02 AM] Phan
quick looking back to the others.  **"Yes, there are a few of us here.  We are searching for people to try to figure out what happened here and hopefully remedy the situation. My name is Phan.  Are you able to come out?  The area out here is empty and safe for the time being."**


[28/06/2023 12:03 AM] Henry
The back door behind the bars creaks open and a aged canine shuffle in with a bewildered look on his face.  **"What?  But how did you get here?  I thought we were cut off.  What's going on?"**


[28/06/2023 12:05 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Cut off?  This place is a little overrun, but what do you mean by cut off?"** The aasimar asks approaching the bars.


[28/06/2023 12:06 AM] Phan
**"We've been clearing a safe pathway to the city at the request of Mr. McFlourish.  Those two (pointing to Dhan'ya and Steve) have more recently come from the town and can tell you if it's a safe travel between here and there if you would like to try to make your way back."**  Hearing Dhan'ya's question he looks curius to hear the answer. **"Good catch on that Dhan'ya... I didn't think about that."**


[28/06/2023 12:09 AM] Henry
The man's eyes light up at the name of McFlourish.  **"Ahh Bandit's on the case?  Well it'll probably be wrapped up by lunch time then.  What are we having for lunch anyway?  A cut of what?  Cut off you say?  We got cut off from the others but holed up here.  I don't think the others are doing very well though.  A bit hard of hearing perhaps."**


[28/06/2023 7:19 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"are the others here? At this compound"** steve starts to just look around see if there are any notes or signs of how many could be here or reports of things going wrong


[29/06/2023 12:49 AM] Henry
**"They're in here.  I think they're sleeping.  They're probably tired after all the fighting.  So much fighting."** the man says regretfully.


[29/06/2023 5:35 AM] Phan
looking to Henry with a bit of curiosity to his response shrugs it off.  **"Well, I can tell you the entry building is currently safe or if you feel safe in here and don't mind staying here for a bit, we are going to continue to search the grounds and search for others that may still be stranded here.  You can either make your attempts to head back to town now, or wait until we have cleared the place and we can come and let you know for sure it is safe and secure. I will leave that choice to you Henry"**


[30/06/2023 3:13 AM] Phan
Phan turns to the group.  **"Shall we check that door over there as well and see what that leads to or shall we continue on to the next building?"**


[2/07/2023 1:45 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"i think we should clear this building first. make sure nothing can get us on the way back"**


[2/07/2023 11:41 PM] Henry
**"That door's where the spiders came in.  Don't know if they're still there or not or if they scurried off after they attacked us.  That was before the others attacked me.  They must have been really tired to attack me.  But I'm safe enough now that they're sleeping."**


[2/07/2023 11:42 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"The others attacked you?  And now they're sleeping?  Umm.  I hope you don't mind my mentioning it, but that seems a little odd."**


[3/07/2023 12:03 AM] Phan
**"Yeah, I agree that is odd. How about we just take a quick look at the others here to see if they need any urgent help. And if spiders came through the other door... Let's leave it closed and lock it if possible.*"" Phan slowly starts to walk towards the office door.


[3/07/2023 12:07 AM] WMDM
The office door and Henry are behind thick iron bars.


[3/07/2023 12:18 AM] WMDM
Phan notices a section of the bars that seem old and rusted.  A possible way of getting through if they could be forced.


[3/07/2023 5:16 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"Henry did they fall asleep on there own or did you put them to sleep?"**


[3/07/2023 11:28 AM] Henry
**"I had to put them to sleep so they'd stop attacking me."** he says voice shaking.


[3/07/2023 10:03 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"Henry please be clear with this, are they still alive?"** steve grabs his crossbow and just holds it at his side


[4/07/2023 10:21 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"When you say put them to sleep, did you use a spell? Or a hammer?"**


[4/07/2023 11:42 PM] Henry
Henry lifts a thick pipe up in front of him and stares at it for a second before suddenyl dropping it with a clatter on the ground that almost drowns out his gasp.  **"Nonononono.  What have I done? What did I do?  Ahhhhhh."**  He runs for the door behind him and opens it quickly about to dash through.


[5/07/2023 10:40 AM] Phan
seeing what is about to transpire, Phan looks to Henry and the only thing he can think of doing is to shout, **'Wait! Do not leave yet!"**


[5/07/2023 4:18 PM] Henry
The arrow thuds into the back of Henry's thigh and he collapses to the ground, sprawling through the door.  **"Ahhh!  They're back!  They're back!"** He cries before starting to crawl away.


[7/07/2023 3:54 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**Henry! Turn about and come talk to us before there are more arrows"**


[7/07/2023 9:26 PM] Henry
Henry keeps crawling.


[7/07/2023 9:40 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Hey no!  Don't shoot the poor man!"** Dhan'ya cries out in alarm.


[7/07/2023 9:40 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"i dont want to hit you again henry, but i cant have you hurting any more people


[7/07/2023 9:42 PM] Phan
Looking to the others **"I'm with Dhan'ya. Henry, please don't run! We need to talk to you so we can help you and all those sleeping!"**


[7/07/2023 9:47 PM] Phan
Phan runs to the door and tries to open it.


[7/07/2023 9:48 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"henry please come back and talk"** steve notches another arrow


[7/07/2023 9:51 PM] WMDM
Opening the other door Phan sees a short corridor with another door at the other end, slightly ajar, darkness behind it.  Along the walls of the short corridor are a series of lockers built into the wall.  A few of the metal doors are wide open, some are just open a crack.  There is a pile of old clothing hanging out of one of the open lockers.


[7/07/2023 9:52 PM] Henry
**"No stay away!"** Henry starts crawling to the side around the door frame and will be out of sight soon.


[7/07/2023 9:53 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Oh please Steve!  He's already injured, he's not a threat!"** Dhan'ya says pleadingly.


[7/07/2023 9:54 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"well i think he is slow enough. we should quickly find a way into that room"** steve lowers his bow but keeps the arrow notched and moves over into the corridore


[7/07/2023 9:59 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya follows Phan into the corridor.  **"Are you scouting ahead quietly Phan?  Oh wait.  Before we get into trouble again, let me just..."**  The aasimar incants an Aid spell and targets her three companions.


[7/07/2023 10:26 PM] Phan
**"Good idea, I'll go quick and quiet.  If you hear me call out, come quick. otherwise you can just follow slowly as well if you would like"**


[7/07/2023 10:28 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"ill be ready at the door"**


[10/07/2023 6:48 AM] WMDM
As Phan creeps forward silently he does notice some minor webbing in and around the door frame.  Peeking his head around the door he can see a large room which looks like the bulk of the building.  Along each wall are what looks like cell doors though all of them are either open or off their hinges.  Light is filtering in through grimy windows high up in the ceiling though the corners and some of the cells are only dimly lit.  The webbing is more pronounced in here and covers the ceilings and walls.  Towards the back of the room in the webbing Phan catches sight of an array of glowing yellow eyes which scurries into the darkness.  The creature it belonged to can't have been much bigger than Phan.


[10/07/2023 7:58 AM] Phan
Phan flags the others down bringing them in and points into the room making a spider motion with his hands signaling danger in the room and to be ready . He pulls his spear out and gets it at the ready stepping forward slowly and silently keeping as much to the shadows as possible waiting for the others to arrive before going too far all while looking for signs of Henry or any other humanoids and spiders.


[10/07/2023 8:17 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer follows as silently as the chain mail allows. Hold his mace and shield at the ready he looks into the room that Phan pointed out.


[10/07/2023 9:16 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve slowly creeps up behind hemmer with his bow in hand ready to move when the others signal, whispering as he gets close to them **"did you see how many are in there?"**


[10/07/2023 9:30 PM] Phan
whispering, **"I haven't seen a number yet just know that they are back there"** *Phan points to the back of the room where the big webbing is* **"Though I know we need to deal with this, we also need to deal with Henry. Anyone have a clue how to go about this? Do we split and have one or two go check him while the rest deal with any spiders in here?"**


[12/07/2023 7:09 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"No idea sorry.  He was crawling away though, and didn't seem like much of a threat at all."** She glares at Steve for a moment.  **"I'll take up the rear.  Who's going first?"**


[12/07/2023 7:12 AM] WMDM
Through the door you see a humanoid figure appear from one of the open cell doors into one of the shadowy areas of the room.  They are shuffling slowly and seem to be normally proportioned except for a slightly large head.


[12/07/2023 7:15 AM] Phan
**"I'm feeling good right now, so I can take the lead. Umm, I'm not the only one seeing this right? I'm afraid to call out too much to draw attention to the spider if I can avoid it."**


[12/07/2023 7:41 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Good call.  Yeah I see it too.  What do you think?  Is it friendly?"**


[12/07/2023 8:44 AM] Phan
**"I don't know. They don't seem concerned about the spider and webbing."**


[13/07/2023 1:00 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Ok.  Well we've got a few things to look out for then."** Dhan'ya says with a nervous gulp.


[13/07/2023 9:41 PM] Phan
Phan nods. **"OK, lets start heading in. I'm definitely feeling unease about those other figures too.  Maybe they just woke up... or maybe there's something more sinister. I don't know."** Phan grips his spear tight for a second then loosens it and slowly starts to head into the room.  Keeping an eye towards the humanoids and the webbing.


[13/07/2023 9:43 PM] WMDM
As Phan pushes through the door into the large room he sees Henry on the ground nearby, seemingly unmoving, perhaps unconscious.  The others in the room don't seem to have noticed his presence yet.


[13/07/2023 9:45 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
As Dhan'ya follows she puts a hand on the door pushing it slightly.


[13/07/2023 9:45 PM] Phan
Phan seeing Henry points to him and looks to Dhan'ya. **"Can you check him while keep watch?"**


[13/07/2023 9:45 PM] WMDM
*Screeee* the door's hinge makes a scraping sound.


[13/07/2023 9:46 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya cringes as she take the opportunity to go and see to Henry.


[13/07/2023 9:49 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"He's out, but he'll be ok."** She whispers back to Phan.


[13/07/2023 9:51 PM] Phan
Phan nods and whispers back **"Excellent, let's keep looking for others... though I think it's about time to draw attention to those things away from Henry so that we can keep him safe."** Phan looks for a place they may be able to carefully hide him/move him.


[13/07/2023 9:54 PM] WMDM
The only nearby places Phan can see to move Henry are the room he's just crawled out of or the room Phan has just come from.


[14/07/2023 9:36 PM] Phan
Phan nods to Henry and looks to Steve and Hemmer.  **"Think you can get him through that door real quick? I want to make sure he's safe so we can find out what happened and where these sleeping people are. Then get your weapon ready because I have a feeling we're going to have trouble soon."** Phan shakes his head a bit and readies his spear taking two steps further into the room.


[15/07/2023 1:55 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding.  Resting his mace and shield against the wall.  Moving around to a place where he can grip Henry's wrists and pull him to a safer place.


[15/07/2023 5:02 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve puts his arrow away and slings his bow on his back, he creeps over to henry's legs and helps hemmer lift him to quietly move him away


[16/07/2023 1:25 AM] WMDM
Henry's unconcious body isn't hard to move back into the room he came from.  The perspective from behind the iron bars doesn't reveal anything exciting.
Meanwhile Phan's observations don't reveal much either.  The humaniod shuffling out of the cell hasn't seemed to notice anything at this stage.


[18/07/2023 12:25 AM] Phan
Looking to the others... **"Well, I think there's only one thing left to do. We need to get their attention and hopefully clear the building and make it safe too."** And with that, Phan takes another step forward and looking towards the shuffling humanoid he says, **"Hey, you doing alright over there?"** And watches to see if he draws the attention of the spider as well ready to run to the rescue of the humanoid if they are friendly.


[20/07/2023 12:38 AM] WMDM
The humaniod turns quickly to face Phan and starts shuffling towards him.  Coming into the light everyone can now see what looks like a normal human except it's head it entirely wrapped in what must be spider web.  It's neck twists awkwardly to one side as it shuffles closer to you.  In the darkness two more sets of glowing eyes appear.


[20/07/2023 12:42 AM] Phan
Phan grips his spear tighter in readying himself and turns over his shoulder to the others quick. **"Umm... yeah, not friendly. Here we go again!"**


[21/07/2023 7:18 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya incants a spell quietly and the humaoid slumps to the ground.  **"It's only asleep, but let's get the spiders."** She says determinedly.


[21/07/2023 11:04 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer aims his shield at the creature and quickly casts a spell


[22/07/2023 12:17 AM] WMDM
One of the spiders skitters forward, slinging a web at Phan.  The tabaxi dodges out of the way narrowly missing being stuck again.


[23/07/2023 6:19 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve see's the spider start to move across the room and hastily sends an arrow across the room missing


[23/07/2023 6:27 AM] Phan
Phan moves up to the spider that tried to web him and stabs out with his spear, narrowly missing the giant spider. He then readies himself for any upcoming attacks preparing to dodge anything that comes at him.


[23/07/2023 10:33 PM] WMDM
Another humanoid with it's head covered in sticky webs appears from the cell, shuffling towards Phan slowly.  The first one rises and moves towards the source of the bolt that hit it.
The spider still hiding in the shadows shoots some web near Phan which he easily avoids.  The other spider scuttles forward and expertly fires webbing at Dhan'ya, wrapping her face in the sticky webs.


[23/07/2023 10:35 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The little aasimar flails against the webbing covering her face, scratching at it uselessly as she hears the muffled sounds of combat around her.


[25/07/2023 1:03 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer moves to cut off any further attack to the little sorceress and unleashes a spell at the spider


[27/07/2023 7:39 PM] jameshurburgh
The spider next to Phan sinks its teeth into the ground next to him.  It was hard to tell if it was trying to attack him or not.


[28/07/2023 10:03 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
seeing the spider heading for phan steve sends an arrow into its side


[28/07/2023 10:30 AM] Phan
Phan looks to the spider as the arrow hits its side and stabs its side then quickly follows up with two devastating swipes of his claws separating its mandibles from its head.


[28/07/2023 10:39 AM] WMDM
The second humaniod rushes Phan slamming him against the wall.


[28/07/2023 10:41 AM] WMDM
The first one continues towards Hemmer who blocks an attack easily with his shield.


[28/07/2023 10:43 AM] WMDM
The last spider just manages to sink it's teeth into Phan and the Tabaxi feels a sting as the arachnid's toxin enters his body.


[28/07/2023 10:46 AM] WMDM
Hemmer finds himself bravely protecting Dhan'ya and facing another spider but bats away it's attempt to bite him.


[28/07/2023 10:47 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Finding the weak point, Dhan'ya finally rips most of the webbing off her face and looks around to see what's still threatening them.


[30/07/2023 7:05 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer looks between the nearest enemies and releases a spell at the humaniod.


[31/07/2023 5:55 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve sees the spider start moving towards hemmer and takes a quick shot at the creature but in his hast he misses


[31/07/2023 6:36 AM] Phan
After the bite and slam by the spider and zombie, Phan decides to target the spider first as the sting of poison isn't fun. A quick jab and two swipes with his claws and the spider looks quite hurt... And angry...


[31/07/2023 10:25 PM] WMDM
The webfaced humaniods slam themselves useless against Phan and Hemmer, but the spider sinks it's fangs into Phan again injecting more toxic venom.


[31/07/2023 10:26 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya unleashes a flurry of magic missiles at the nearest spider knocking it over dead.


[1/08/2023 12:45 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer holds the line against the humanoid.  He mutters out a spell that seems to fizzle out


[2/08/2023 12:29 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve seeing the monsters at hemmer and dhan'ya he does what he can to help out and shoots the undead thing closest to him


[2/08/2023 12:40 PM] Phan
Phan finally takes down another spider and turns to swipe at the zombie next to him. The blood in his eyes makes it near impossible to see straight causing him to miss. He then turns over his shoulder to Hemmer. **"I could use a heal if you got one!"** And winces a bit in pain as he faces the zombie ready for whatever is about to happen.


[2/08/2023 5:53 PM] WMDM
The two remaining humaoids slam at the party uselessly.


[2/08/2023 5:54 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Seeing Phan by himself and looking hurt Dhan'ya takes the opportunity to run over and divine power flows through her healing some of his wounds.


[3/08/2023 1:10 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer pushes his shield at toward the humanoid muttering a spell at it. As he hears the sound of the strike he changes to a prayer of healing sending the energy out to Phan.


[3/08/2023 8:19 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve see's the last of the undead trying to end this quick but only just hitting it with his bow but not really making a dent


[3/08/2023 8:38 AM] Phan
now that the spider is dealt with, Phan focuses on the zombie and after striking him with his spear quickly follows up with a kick to the abdomen causing it to wiggle a little more. He then turns to Dhan and Hemmer, **"Thanks both of you. I feel a lot more steady."**


[4/08/2023 7:54 AM] WMDM
As Phan turns to the others the humanoid slams into him again, though not as violently as before as it looks shaky on it's feet.


[4/08/2023 7:55 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya gives a weak smile.  **"It's not over yet!"** She says as she brings sacred flames down around the creature, who seems to survive unscathed.


[4/08/2023 9:03 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer calls forth the spell directed at the last humanoid.


[4/08/2023 9:04 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**Down to one, I dont see anymore of their friends**


[4/08/2023 9:05 AM] WMDM
The last threat falls and the building is quiet once again.


[4/08/2023 9:07 AM] Phan
Phan looks to the others. **"Well, that was fun. We should probably check on our injured friend out there and look around to see if there are any holes on the building that need patched. Those humanoid things were different... "**


[4/08/2023 9:17 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
"Yeah I will stay away and might search around while you guys see if you can get anything out of him"


[4/08/2023 9:24 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Kneeling down and looking over the humanoid more closely


[4/08/2023 9:27 AM] Phan
**"I am going to quick check cells looking for anything useful or any holes in the walls that would let big spiders through."**


[4/08/2023 11:13 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**solid plan.  Im going to look over these things.  They dont seem to be the same as the other things weve seen here**


[8/08/2023 9:34 PM] WMDM
The cells on the east side are fairly bare.  It looks like they've been converted into storage and have a few shelves, boxes and crates but most contain nothing useful.  On the western side at the back of the first call Phan finds an Explorer's Pack propped up against the wall.  In the next cell along are two more humanoids, laying on the ground, their faces covered in sticky webs.  It doesn't take long to realise they're already dead, their bodies bruised and beaten.  In the last cell The Tabaxi finds what he was looking for, a small hole in the ceiling around 2 feet across.  Just big enough for a spider of the size you just fought to squeeze through.  Looking around you realise that if you could secure the cell door it would stop any more spiders of that size getting any further.


[8/08/2023 9:40 PM] WMDM
As Hemmer investigates the humanoids he soon realises they were of the same race as the Brisbandites.  Their canine features completely covered by webbing.  With a little effort the cleric pulls most of the sticky mess off, but the last layer seems fused to their faces and won't separate.


[8/08/2023 9:41 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya stays with Hemmer while the others search the room.  **"Oh this is just awful.  Do you think the webbing turned them into those, those mindless things?  Or could it be something else?"**


[8/08/2023 9:52 PM] Phan
Looking back to the others. **"Anyone see any keys around? Maybe Henry has some? I think it would be ideal to close and lock this cell.  There's a hole that will need to be dealt with at some time. But if we can get that closed, at least the bigger spiders are not going to be able to get in.  I'm going to try to at least give us a little just-in-case time."** Phan then tries to slide the door and pulls a bit of rope from his backpack he is wearing and attempts to tie the bars closed until a key can be found.


[8/08/2023 10:43 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Looking up at the little sorceress **"Never heard of a spider that could do this.  I've fought them before and never seen anything like it. "**. Looking over the bodies and through the gear they are wearing


[9/08/2023 7:33 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"No.  Me neither Hemmer."** She stands and nods at Phan.  **"I'll see if I can find some keys."** she says and walks off to the partitioned office where Henry had been left.


[9/08/2023 7:35 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The sorceress returns a minute later with a jangling sound, smiling as she holds a set of keys out for Phan.  **"Henry is still out I'm afraid."**


[9/08/2023 7:45 AM] Phan
Phan takes the keys. **"Thanks. I'm going to try and lock that door with the hinges just in case there is something that could untie the knot or slice the rope. "** Phan then turns and begins attempting to get the door locked hoping to find the right key.


[9/08/2023 7:59 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"If that doesn't work I can heat the metal to a melting point and weld it that way. "**


[9/08/2023 7:29 PM] WMDM
It doesn't take long to go through the keys and find one that works in the lock.  With a **clank** the latch snaps into place and giving the door a tug it seems secure.


[9/08/2023 9:34 PM] Phan
Phan heads back to the others near the doors**"That cell door looks to be secure being both tied and locked.  We should be safe from any of the larger variety spiders.  Shall we tend to our friend in there and maybe take a bit of a rest? Or can we? I'm a bit winded right now and could use an hour if possible before stepping to our next location. Or those of you that want to keep working and searching feel free.  There's a backpack kit over in that cell if anyone needs it.  It matches what I have."**


[10/08/2023 8:18 AM] WMDM
Steve slices through the webs easily with his sword and peers out the back window.  He sees the western fence with a few large webs attched to it and the ground.  Beyond that the forest blocks any other view.  Looking down at his sword to see the webs sticking to it and peering close Steve sees the webs have what look like tiny tendrils, barely visible, reaching out from them, writhing gently as if searching.


[12/08/2023 5:47 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**if you need a rest Phan settle in.  I have a feeling we aren't really going to find any one else alive"**


[13/08/2023 8:18 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Well I don't like the idea of sleeping in here, but I'm pretty much spent until I get a good night's sleep."** Dhan'ya says before walking back to the office.  **"I'll check on Henry.  Let me know if you need me."**


[14/08/2023 2:44 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I don't see any movement out side so if we stay in here I belive we will be ok"** still looking at the webbing on his sword, **"but try not get close to those webs, they almost seem alive"**


[18/08/2023 10:16 PM] Phan
Phan stands up after his meditation and walks through the door to where Dhan'ya and Henry are.  Looking to see if there's anything he can do to help.  **"How's it looking in here Miss Dhan'ya?"**


[25/08/2023 11:45 PM] WMDM
Henry looks up as Phan enters.


[25/08/2023 11:45 PM] Henry
**"What's going on?  Who are you?  How did I get hurt?"** he says confused.


[25/08/2023 11:47 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"He doesn't seem to remember anything now.  Not even what he told us before.  I think he's had too much of a shock."** Dhan'ya says to Phan looking worried.


[25/08/2023 11:50 PM] Phan
Stopping to think and looking concerened. **"It's been a crazy bit of time here Mr. Henry.  Do you remember the spiders coming in? There's some strange stuff going on for sure.  We've taken care of that so that this area is safer for a moment."** Pausing and thinking about what Steve said, Phan looks back to Dhan'ya. **"Do you think it might be wise to escort him back to the office in the main building quick before we go next to the "safe" labeled building? I'm not sure leaving anyone here with that strange webbing is a good idea.  And he can rest in there and hopefully recuperate."**


[25/08/2023 11:52 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The aasimar nods emphatically.  **"Yes.  I don't think it would be a good idea to take him with us, but this area doesn't seem like a good place to stay either."**


[25/08/2023 11:52 PM] Henry
**"Spiders?  No we cleared those out.  No spiders left now.  Saw one as big as my hand once!"**


[25/08/2023 11:57 PM] Phan
Looking to Henry.  **"Well, Mr. Henry.  You seem to have hit your head and have lost some of what happened recently. Let me reintroduce myself. My name is Phan.  There's a lot going on here and this place isn't safe.  We are going to escort you back to the main building to hide in the office there where we know it to be safe.  We are still looking to see if anyone else is in any of the buildings here.  As far as how you got hurt, there's a story to tell for that one, but  it will need to wait until after we have inspected the other buildings and secured the area."**


[17/09/2023 10:30 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"maybe 2 of us should walk Henry back to the first room and the other stay here until they return then we move on to the next rooms"** Steve says as he continues to stare out the windows


[17/09/2023 11:15 PM] Phan
**"Maybe, however what you said about the web gives me an uncomfortable feeling about splitting up. If say the first we should split would be to have 2 walk him inside the building while the others stand watch. Help him get to the couch and lay down for a bit on that for a while while we check and secure the rest of the compound."**


[17/09/2023 11:19 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"agreed they are a concern, hopefully we can find out something more soon"**


[17/09/2023 11:44 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"I'm with you.  Let's stick together.  To be honest I could do with a longer rest than before myself.  I think Henry might benefit from getting away from where... All this happened, as well."**


[17/09/2023 11:47 PM] Phan
**"Shall we ask go relax and recoup back in the main office then? If any other buildings are like this one, we should all be as ready as well can. I have a feeling this might get rough."**


[17/09/2023 11:59 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Sounds like a great idea."**


[18/09/2023 6:21 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"Yeah I think we could all use a long rest and use this to regather, also take the chance to check everything is still OK and nothing has changed"**


[19/09/2023 6:50 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya helps Henry to his feet again and starts leading him back through to the front entrance of the building.


[19/09/2023 6:50 AM] Henry
**"Thank you my dear child.  Where are the others?  Aren't they coming too?"**


[19/09/2023 6:51 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Uuuuh.  Your friends are going to stay here for a bit longer Henry.  But you come with us."**


[19/09/2023 6:53 AM] WMDM
The trip back to the main entrance building is uneventful.  A few spiders are seen through the fence in the distance, but none seem to notice you.  It seems like ages since you were last looking around this building but everything seems to be where you left it.


[19/09/2023 7:23 AM] Phan
Finding a spot in the office and sitting, Phan looks to Henry as he enters. **"I'm sure you may have questions, but first, it has been a rough day for us. Once we rest, we are going to check the rest of the compound. We will gladly answer questions for you, however you also are injured and really should rest as well."** Phan then leans back into the corner but keeps an eye towards the door and Henry.


[29/09/2023 9:27 PM] Henry
**"I'm more confused than anything else.  None of my friends are here anymore and I'm not sure what's going on."** Henry says quietly.


[29/09/2023 9:30 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya sits with Henry and spends some time reassuring him that everything is going to be ok and that he can trust them.


[29/09/2023 9:31 PM] WMDM
Henry falls asleep quickly muttering to himself as he does so.


[29/09/2023 9:39 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I think we need to try and move quickly through here before he wakes and disturbs the peace"**


[29/09/2023 9:41 PM] Phan
Phan looks to Steve and Dhan'ya. **"This is going to be a much needed rest. Thank you both for coming and helping. When we sent the others as escorts, we didn't realize how bad this was going to get. It's nice having you here."**


[29/09/2023 9:43 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"always happy to help, the more we can save and help here the better"**


[29/09/2023 9:43 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya rejoins to others **"My question is, what are we going to do with him?  It doesn't seem right to leave him here by himself, but I'm not sure we should take him with us either."** she says with a worried look on her face.


[29/09/2023 9:46 PM] Phan
**"if we ask him to lock after we leave, he should be safe. I definitely wouldn't feel right bringing him further into danger considering what was done already."**


[29/09/2023 9:50 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"as long as this room holds, God's forbid anything else to happen to him"**


[29/09/2023 10:08 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The aasimar nods.  **"That sounds like a good idea.  I'm going to find somewhere to lie down."** she says yawning.


[29/09/2023 10:10 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve nestles up in a corner and gets some rest


[29/09/2023 10:11 PM] Phan
Phan nods and meditates for a short period then closes his eyes and joins in the slumber.

[3/10/2023 6:11 PM] WMDM
The night passes without incident and the party is woken by the morning sunlight beginning to stream in through the windows.


[3/10/2023 6:13 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Oh that feels much better."** Dhan'ya says stretching and arching her back.   **"Though not quite as comfortable as back in Brisbandit I must say."** she prepares some basic food for herself and the others humming quietly to herself while she works.


[4/10/2023 6:50 AM] Phan
Phan stretches and flexes his claws in and out. **"I've slept in more odd places for sure, but I feel good about that rest.  I like the corner of a room though. It really supports me when sitting in a meditative position. Well.  Shall we head to the 'Safe' labeled building? Check there and then continue on, or check on the buildings to the right first for survivors?"**


[4/10/2023 6:56 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Good morning Phan."** Dhan'ya point to the map. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1085381989361786980/1109292294135361596/map_49x30.png?ex=651d6934&is=651c17b4&hm=d36748d4c1019a005501114e56c14477829aae1ce84f31980162035ee082f959&
**"I like the idea of looking where the survivors are most likely to be.  But I don't want to be trapped with them if anything else is still able to get in.  There's one more building on the left, but two on the right.  Are you still wanting to make sure everything is clear so we don't get trapped from behind or do you think it's more important to see if there is anyone still alive in the 'safe' room?"** she askes with worried looking eyes.

[4/10/2023 7:02 AM] Phan
**'I'm not one to like risking something coming from behind. We fixed the gate to the right, but that could have let something understandable in on that side before we fixed it. If the others are amenable, I'm fine checking the right 2 buildings first."**


[4/10/2023 7:19 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve slowly wakes hearing the talks from the others, **"agreed we should cover our backs first and be sure it's safe to take anyone out of here"**


[4/10/2023 10:53 AM] Phan
Looking one more time at the map, **"I say we go to the building straight to the right first then the building passed the repaired section after. We can check how well the repair is holding too."*


[4/10/2023 5:43 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
The little aasimar nods in agreement.  **"Ok then.  Well let's head that way when everyone's ready then.  And ahhh...  What are we doing about Henry?  I'll ask him to stay here and not go wandering shall I?"**


[4/10/2023 5:44 PM] Henry
Henry is curled in a ball under a blanket and stirs at the mention of his name.  **"Huh?  Morning.  Where is everyone?  Who are you?"**


[4/10/2023 5:48 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya kneels down beside the man and takes on of his hands in hers.  **"Henry, I'm Dhan'ya.  We rescued you from some spiders.  You'll be safe, but you need to stay in this building ok?  Because there are more spiders outside.  Dangerous ones.  We need to go see if we can rescue your friends and bring them back."**


[4/10/2023 5:48 PM] Henry
The man seem to understand and nods at the little sorcerer.


[4/10/2023 9:52 PM] Phan
**"We appreciate your patience with us Henry. When we go, make sure that the door is closed tight behind us. We will knock and announce ourselves to have you know it is us when we come back."**  Phan grabs his spear and checks his pack and stands next to the door ready and waiting for the others to follow.


[6/10/2023 6:53 AM] Henry
Henry nods at Phan as well.  **"Thank you all for doing this.  I'll...  I'll just clean up round here I suppose."**


[6/10/2023 6:54 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Thanks Henry.  That would be wonderful.  Well.  Let's go clear this building to the right then."** She says grabbing her equipment and setpping through the doorway.


[6/10/2023 6:57 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve gets up aswell and heads over to the door with dhan'ya **"let's get this sorted fast"**


[8/10/2023 8:43 AM] WMDM
Outside the building everything seems to the seems the same.


[8/10/2023 8:44 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"There does seem to be a little more spider webs around the fences over there."** Dhan'ya comments peering through the wire surrounding them.


[8/10/2023 9:38 AM] Phan
Phan nods. **"We should keep our eyes peeled for those tummy buggers. Let's get heading to that building."** Phan points to the building straight ahead to the right.


[10/10/2023 5:42 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"just keep our heads down and move quickly i think"** steve crouches and moves along the corridor


[10/10/2023 6:05 AM] Phan
thinking.  **"Maybe you are right and a silent approach between buildings might be worth a try.  Try to avoid drawing attention as much as possible."**


[10/10/2023 6:06 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"the less we encounter these things the better i think'**


[11/10/2023 2:45 AM] Phan
Phan looks back to the door making sure Hemmer is through.   **"We should make sure the door is shut tight too.  Just in case.  Don't want to come back to find the safety we've created in this building has been undone."**


[12/10/2023 12:42 PM] WMDM
Steve, Phan, and Dhan'ya makes it along the length of the passage to the east building without attracting attention.  Like the other doors in the complex, it looks heavy and secure and is currently closed.  The building looks undamaged.  A few secure windows, outside the security fence you're in, are facing you, but from this angle it's impossible to see anything of interest in the building.


[12/10/2023 2:02 PM] WMDM
Hemmer joins them a moment later.


[12/10/2023 6:32 PM] Phan
**"Well, it looks o, but looks can definitely be deceiving. Shall we try to go in and take a look around for people? Or should I at least take a fast look around?"** Phan moved a bit closer to the door and tentatively checks to see if the door is locked.


[12/10/2023 7:24 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I think together and quietly, the best we can"** Steve says as he moves up with phan to see if there is any way he could help


[12/10/2023 8:38 PM] WMDM
The door is locked.


[12/10/2023 8:43 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Sounds like a good idea.  Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.  Oh I know, everyone just wait a second."** Dhan'ya says before incanting a spell...


[12/10/2023 8:44 PM] Phan
Turning to the others. **"It appears to be locked, we can knock or I can try to pick the lock. What say you?"** Phan shuffles into his pouch quick pulling out a set of lock picking tools.


[12/10/2023 8:54 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Whatever you decide may the gods be with you."** Dhan'ya says with a smile, touching Phan's arm softly and transferring the power of the spell into him.


[12/10/2023 8:56 PM] Phan
Phan nods and looks towards the locking mechanism. **"Well, let's see how well this door is secured, shall we?"**


[12/10/2023 8:58 PM] WMDM
The lock is unfamiliar to Phan.  For about 3.4 seconds.  That's how long it takes him to convince the tumblers to line up, and that's including retrieving the lock picks from his belt.


[12/10/2023 9:01 PM] WMDM
The door opens outwards and inside the building is gloomy and the smell of stale decay wafts over you.  As your eyes adjust to the darkness you can see that this building appears to be one large room.  There are various shapes and shadows, but without more light they are hard to make out.


[12/10/2023 9:03 PM] Phan
Phan chuckles to himself. Turning to the others. He says, **"I'm going to step inside the door a second to look for any light switches before we go further. If you have other forms of light, we may need to consider them otherwise.'**


[12/10/2023 11:29 PM] jvanblaricom0001
"that was a lot faster than I expected it to take".


[13/10/2023 9:51 PM] Phan
Phan nods to Hemmer.  **"Either the lock is very basic or partly frozen. I'm guessing this is not one of the more important buildings otherwise that may not have gone as well. That, or I am just a lucky cat today.  I've been working my claws out a bit to try to be more dextrous, so I think that helped."** Taking his step in making sure to stay in sight of the rest of the group. **"A building like this with lights out has to have a switch right here, right?"**


[14/10/2023 7:56 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"one would think so, can you see any of those monsters or people?"** Steve moves up to the open door


[14/10/2023 10:34 PM] WMDM
There is no switch, but as Phan's darkvision adjusts to the dim light inside it reveals the colossal form of the spider resting at its center. The spider is a behemoth of an arachnid, its immense, hairy legs splayed out around it in a sprawling circle, like a dark flower in bloom.  Its body is a dark, velvety black, almost impossible to see in the ambient dim light.  Each leg is thick, covered in coarse hair, and ends in formidable, sharp-tipped bristles, which, in the faint light, glint like silver. Yet, they remain motionless, almost as if the spider has willed them to be at rest.  The room carries the scent of dampness, earth, and old stone, blending with a faint musk from the spider itself. Cobwebs hang in the corners, but the massive spider, rather than weaving, appears to have outgrown such trivial pursuits.  Its many eyes gleam like polished onyx, studying the newcomers with a watchful, unblinking gaze.


[14/10/2023 10:49 PM] jameshurburgh
@john (telem,steve) ||Your Beast Master training helps you notice a few extra details.  The webs around the door are not the same as the webs designed to trap and look more like webs that would hold eggs.  You can't tell where else it's coming from, perhaps the spiders pheremones, but you get the feeling that the occupant of this web is not currently threatening.||


[14/10/2023 10:53 PM] Phan
Phan carefully turns towards the others. And quietly says, **"Um... Not sure you are going to believe this, bit this building is NOT safe right now. Be there is a massive spider in there. I can't make it anything more about the building as I can't find any light source. I just know that spider is bigger than any I've seen yet."**


[15/10/2023 7:42 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I don't mean to sound any more alarms but these webs are different from the last"** Steve shuts his eyes and stands in silence for a moment. Then he turns to the party **"this spider seems different as well"**


[15/10/2023 7:44 AM] Phan
**" Well... Can you elaborate? I agree this is different for sure. The spider is also not charging us too... At least not yet..."**


[15/10/2023 7:51 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I just get the sense the occupants of this Web is non threatening"** with I long pause Steve finishes with a stern **"yet"**


[15/10/2023 7:56 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"are there any signs of people in there phan"**


[15/10/2023 7:58 AM] Phan
Phan turns back inside and lets his eyes adjust again and does another scan of the room looking for signs of possible life other than the spider.


[15/10/2023 9:41 AM] WMDM
There are no other signs of life in the room.  One of the spider's legs moves slowly, scraping along the floor toward the spider a few yards breaking the otherwise silent room.


[15/10/2023 9:49 AM] Astraarach
A chittering sound comes from the beast. (undercommon)||**"What do you want?  Why are you here?"**|| A pause, then more chittering. (abyssal)||**"Do you not speak the common toung?"**|| The spider shifts another leg. (deep speech) ||**"I am tired puny ones.  If you are here to kill me do so quickly."**||


[15/10/2023 10:06 AM] Phan
Looking to the others again... **'Anyone else get a weird feeling it's trying to communicate?"**


[15/10/2023 10:08 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"It's certainly not trying to attack us like the others... That's a good sign."**


[15/10/2023 10:09 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I'm not sure what it said at the start but it said something along the lines of 'I'm tired, if your here to kill me do so quickly',"**


[15/10/2023 10:38 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"You can understand it?"** Dhan'ya says, eyes wide. **"Can you speak to it as well?  Can it understand us?  Are we going to kill it?  It's the first spider that hasn't attacked us outright."** she continues energetically.


[15/10/2023 10:45 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I couldn't understand all of what it said just part of it, I can try and talk to it"** Steve moves slowly over into the room


[15/10/2023 10:48 AM] WMDM
The spider doesn't seem to react other than appearing to keep a watch on you.


[15/10/2023 10:50 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve starts in deep speech **"what happened here?"**


[15/10/2023 10:56 AM] Astraarach
**"We came and made our home here.  Why have you come?"**


[15/10/2023 11:00 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"we came to see what happened to the people here, are you the leader of these arachnids?"**


[15/10/2023 11:25 AM] Astraarach
**"Some of them have followed me.  No more, though some of them were bringing me food until recently.  Now I think I will die here."**


[15/10/2023 11:26 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"did you come here just for a home or did you want to conquer?"**


[15/10/2023 11:47 AM] Phan
**"And where did you come from?"**


[15/10/2023 12:15 PM] Astraarach
**"We came from the west.  I was promised easy food and for a time that was true.  But now this structure has become my tomb."**


[15/10/2023 3:20 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"who told you there was easy food?"**


[15/10/2023 4:27 PM] Astraarach
**"A puny one like you... Not like you.  More like her."** the spider moves a giant leg sightly closer to Dhan'ya.  **"She had some power.  Some way of guiding my less intelligent kin.  But she left them here with me, and now I cannot leave."**


[15/10/2023 4:32 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"do you want to leave or do you want to die?"** Steve looks at the others for any kind of response to what's being said (whispering in common) **"what do you guys think, does this sound like anyone you have heard of?"**


[15/10/2023 4:33 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
(In deep speech) **"how long did you travel till you got here?"**


[15/10/2023 4:35 PM] Astraarach
**"I do not wish to die, but I was foolish and gorged myself here.  Now I have grown too large to escape.  We travelled more than one night.  But less than eight."**


[15/10/2023 5:17 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"did you send the others to attack the city?"**


[15/10/2023 7:53 PM] Astraarach
**"The city?  Towards the sea?  A few went that way.  That may have been her doing, it was not mine."**


[15/10/2023 7:54 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"these were all innocent people, is she anywhere near?"**


[16/10/2023 12:31 AM] Astraarach
**"I find people are rarely innocent.  But she returned back to the west after we came here.  I don't know why but she left the cluster of my kin here."**


[16/10/2023 12:44 AM] Phan
**"I don't know if it is possible, but if we could find a way to get you out of here, would you be willing to head back home to the West? As someone who studies death, I can say there is release there for those that are tortured. However I do not seek to destroy those that seek to better themselves and are willing to listen to reason."**


[16/10/2023 1:14 AM] Astraarach
The colossal spider does not immediately respond.  **"Is this possible?  Might you be able to free me?  I would not return to where this puny one resides.  No.  I would find some other place to call home."**


[16/10/2023 5:57 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"is there anything in these egg sacks? And would you help find where this puny one could be?"**


[16/10/2023 8:42 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"There have been a few spider attacks over the last few weeks. I have fought them more than once now. Is this one their queen? Does this one know how those others were turned into the spider people we fought?"


[16/10/2023 3:49 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve turns to hemmer **"no i don't believe she is the Queen or any kind of leader, I will see if she knows any more"**


[16/10/2023 3:51 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Going back to astraarach **"are you a queen or something to these other spiders? Why did they bring you food? And do you know anything about the people here being changed into spider like people?"**


[17/10/2023 1:06 AM] Phan
Listening to the latest run of questions.  **"If they don't understand what you mean by spider like people, I would more say controlled bodies/zombie type creatures.  They weren't actually spiderlike.  It was very unnatural for sure."**


[19/10/2023 11:30 PM] Astraarach
**"I am a mother to some, they fed me for awhile, but my children are gone and these webs are now empty.  As for the puny ones being changed to spiders.  There are many a varied types of aranea some with strange abilties.  I do not know all of them but that would it would not surprise me if some secreted a venom that might affect a puny one so.  Now are you going to get me out of here or leave me to die in peace?"**


[19/10/2023 11:32 PM] Phan
Looking to the others then looking back to the giant spider he has Steve translate, **"If you are in agreement that you will leave this place and never return and stay away from the town in this area and all their people, we shall see what we can do for you."**


[19/10/2023 11:35 PM] Astraarach
**"There is nothing I would want more than to leave this place and never return.  If you can get me out I will go north and make a new home for myself in the mountains.  That would satisfy me."**


[19/10/2023 11:37 PM] Phan
Phan nods after hearing that.  **"Then with your permission to look around in here we shall see if we can find any weakpoints to get you out.  We may need to get through a few more buildings to get to the outside however.  No matter the situation and what we find, we will not leave until you know what we find."**


[20/10/2023 7:57 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"do you have anyway to call any of your children who are still around and take them away with you"**


[21/10/2023 11:16 AM] Astraarach
**"I have no interest in disturbing you if you'll do the same to me.  I can call my children now if you'd like."** her chelicerae twitch and you get the feeling it's the equivalent of a cruel smile. **"But if you can help me break free from this prison I will try to draw them away from here with me, which I think you might like more."** The colossal beast resettles itself slightly in the middle of the large room.


[21/10/2023 11:28 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"that would be much better"** Steve says with a chuckle


[21/10/2023 11:29 AM] WMDM
All the buildings are damaged somewhat, but the party is looking for something more structural.  The smooth facade plastered over the walls is coming off in places exposing the more structurally sound masonry beneath.  The ceiling some 20 feet above you is stained and shows water damage with some sections sagging slightly especially in the back left corner.  The steel beams supporting the structure seem to be covered in surface rust, but otherwise seem fairly sound.


[21/10/2023 11:30 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Are there any windows we could make bigger?"** Dhan'ya asks looking around hopefully.


[21/10/2023 12:25 PM] Phan
walking the left wall a little bit. **"I think I see a possibility. It appears that the roof/ceiling here in that corner has been weakened. Maybe there's a way to force it to break open. Maybe we can work together with the giant spider to treat a big enough hole in the roof for them to escape it. Can you ask them Steve?"**


[21/10/2023 12:44 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I will see what she says"** steve turns to the big girl **"how strong are you feeling? we have found what looks like a weak spot in the roof, do you feel you could help us break through there?"**


[21/10/2023 12:54 PM] Astraarach
The spite in her voice is palpable.  **"Do you think I've not tried to break out puny fool?  My strength is not enough and that was when I was at my best."**


[21/10/2023 12:58 PM] jvanblaricom0001
"is there metal inside of that cement? I have seen that in some other places here. If there is perhaps I could heat it up enough to weaken the whole thing  to make it easier to break"


[21/10/2023 1:01 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"do you think you could help us up closer to that part of the roof and we can have a closer look"**


[22/10/2023 5:38 PM] Astraarach
The spider shuffles her colossal body slightly and lifts a giant leg towards the area you indicated holding it hard against the wall to make something that could resemble a platform you could climb onto.


[22/10/2023 5:52 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"hemmer did you want to go up and take a look and see what you can do?"**


[23/10/2023 2:04 AM] jvanblaricom0001
giving a slight shudder, before slowly working his way up the leg. Looking at the weak spot to see how its made"


[24/10/2023 7:38 AM] WMDM
The spider's leg is surprisingly easy to climb with many thick hairs providing purchase.  Once Hemmer gets to the top he gets and excellent view of wall and ceiling.  The cement has crumbled in places exposing the reinforcing bars set into it.  Like most of the other metal in this place it's rusted but seems solid.  The water damage is more apparent closer up.  The ceiling seems  to be squares of plaster board held on a thin metal frame which is also rusted and seems weak.  The three corner tiles of the ceiling seem damp and swollen and the water has obviously dripped down the wall and weakened the cement, though the wall is dry now.


[24/10/2023 7:41 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer reaches into his bag and places a torch against the reinforcing bars.  Pulling out the tinderbox to light the torch before climbing back down the leg.


[24/10/2023 7:42 AM] jvanblaricom0001
" I would suggest we all move back, I've never tried this and not really sure how things will fare"


[24/10/2023 7:48 AM] jvanblaricom0001
He begins to whisper the incantation as he points at the bars.  Holding his concentration as they start to change color.


[24/10/2023 8:23 PM] Phan
Phan looks to Hemmer. **"I don't really have much I can help with, bit of you need a little more muscle, or if you have a hammer I can borrow; to help got the bars... I'll come up and help."**


[25/10/2023 12:18 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"Let's see what we get after a minute of that heating up. That may have weakened it enough to punch through"


[25/10/2023 12:24 PM] WMDM
The exposed metal bars begin to glow red and the spider quickly retracts its leg.  After 30 seconds a faint mist can faintly be seen wafting out of the concrete near the water damaged section.   A few seconds later the concrete near the red metal bar give out a crunching sound as a chunk a few inches wide and a few feet tall is pushed out of the wall, more steam and mist pushing it out.  The crack continues down the wall until the entire height of the building has a gap a few inches wide exposing the red hot iron bar inside.  Light streams in through the gap the colossal spider moves away from it slightly before seeming to adjust and relax again.


[25/10/2023 12:47 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer walk closer to it while its still hot and slams his mace into the crumbling wall


[26/10/2023 11:09 PM] Phan
Phan grabs his spear and prepares to help knock away and larger chunks that may come inward. He then looks with a smile to Hemmer and shouts up, **"That's pretty impressive Mr. Hemmer. I can see why you are good with a forge."**


[27/10/2023 6:37 AM] WMDM
With a resolute swing of his mace, Hemmer strikes the weakened section of the wall, causing a thunderous crash as concrete and debris fly in all directions.

The colossal spider, reacting swiftly, retracts its legs and moves gracefully away from the collapsing wall, avoiding the cascading rubble. In response to Hemmer's powerful strike, a significant portion of the wall crumbles, creating a hole that is roughly the size of a doorway. Within the opening, red-hot metal bars gleam, exposed in the midst of the demolished structure.

Unperturbed, Hemmer doesn't stop at a single blow. He swings his mace repeatedly, each strike delivering a heavy blow to the compromised wall. With each impact, more and more of the concrete gives way, revealing the intricate framework beneath. Dust and debris fill the air as the colossal spider, graceful and nimble despite its size, keeps a safe distance from the falling remnants.

Gradually, the wall crumbles further under Hemmer's relentless assault. Larger sections of concrete give out, and a path begins to emerge, providing enough space for the colossal spider to crawl through. With each strike, the gap widens, and the room fills with the echoes of Hemmer's powerful blows and the crunching sounds of dislodged material.


[27/10/2023 6:39 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya watches in amazement trying to call out words of encouragement over the noise of the crumbling wall, but mostly standing around giving what she hopes are encouraging smiles to the spider.


[27/10/2023 2:10 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Stepping back as the steel cools and the concrete stops falling.  "The reinforcement isn't cold yet but that should allow you to leave"


[27/10/2023 9:10 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Turning to the spider **"I hope this has helped you and you have the strength to get where you need to go away from here"**


[27/10/2023 9:30 PM] Phan
Phan says, **"Please also remember that though not all humanoids are bad, there are some out there that would hurt you and your families. Especially if something is done to provoke them. We will try to find this small one that has caused you and yours problems and hopefully make sure they cause no more issues. We will bring the information you have shared with us back to the town and work together. Those of your family that will go with you, may leave in peace. Those that feel like staying to try to feed here still shall find it not so pleasant. It has been my honor meeting someone such as yourself."** Phan bows briefly to the gigantic spider.


[28/10/2023 11:36 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"may you travel swiftly giant friend"** Steve goes over to the rest of the party, **"shall we continue to look through the last of the compound"**


[31/10/2023 1:09 AM] Astraarach
The spider tentatively moves towards the newly made gap and places a leag on either side of it as if gauging it's width.  Seemingly satisfied she turned to the group.  **"Well small ones, you have done me a service.  If you are ever to visit the mountains to the north you may find me able to return the favour."** With that she sidles through the holes and out onto the field outside stretching her legs as she does so.  She stops and makes a loud chittering sound and then waits.  Skittering sounds come from outside and soon she is surrounded by dozens of spiders big and small.  She gives another chitter and begins walking quickly away.  Around half the gather spiders follow her, some skittering ahead, some climbing her legs and being carried.  The rest watch as the collosal spider disappears then begin milling around.


[31/10/2023 1:18 AM] Phan
Phan looks to the remaining spiders then to the rest of the group. **"Well friends, should we back out quietly and close this door and deal with them later or assume that they are staying for bad reasons and call attention to ourselves to get them in and take care of them now?"** Phan takes a quiet step backwards but grabs his spear in a readied position.


[31/10/2023 6:13 PM] WMDM
The spiders milling around begin to spread out.  Steve quickly and silently points to one of them creeping around the side of the gap in the wall.  Long legs testing the surface's strength it seems preoccupied with the wall and hasn't noticed you yet.


[31/10/2023 7:07 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
carefully moving and whispering to the team **"should we see if they are intelligent as well or just back away?"**


[31/10/2023 7:09 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"I don't they're like the big one."**  Dhan'ya whispers as she slowly backs towards the door.


[31/10/2023 7:19 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"yeah we should avoid them as much we can, unless we want to take them out"**


[31/10/2023 7:20 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve slowly moves away from the gap trying to give himself as much space from them he can


[31/10/2023 8:50 PM] WMDM
As Steve steps backwards he kicks a piece of cement that had fallen from the wall and is goes skittering across the floor.  The giant spider in the wall looks at him and gives a quick chitter.


[31/10/2023 9:30 PM] Phan
Phan freezes in his tracks and looks at Steve. **"No worries friend.  I'm guessing they would have noticed us anyway.  We either run fast or prep for a fight.  Maybe we should get to the door area in case we need to make a quick exit."**


[31/10/2023 9:38 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"sounds good, can't hurt to take out what we can"**


[1/11/2023 7:45 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"If we can get them into a single room I could try the heated metal trick again"


[1/11/2023 8:26 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I also have my acid breth if we can get them in a group together"**


[2/11/2023 12:54 AM] WMDM
Three spiders have crawled through the gap and are slowly walking towards the group.  They are currently 45 feet away.


[2/11/2023 5:24 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
watching the spiders walk in, Steve cast hunters mark on the first spider he sees, then he hastily sends an arrow in there direction


[2/11/2023 9:21 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya incants a spell but the spiders seem unaffected. **"Blast it, they're too big!"** She says worriedly.


[2/11/2023 9:39 PM] Phan
Phan sees where the arrow flew and jumps into action. Catlike reflexes he stabs quickly at the first spider with his spear quickly dispatching it.  Bolstered by the quick kill, he quickly turns and unleashes a flurry with his claws at the second spider. **"Don't hesitate, now is not the time. We've dealt with strange already and these spiders are seemingly fairly normal."**


[3/11/2023 6:42 AM] WMDM
The two remaining spiders lunge at Phan on of them managing to land a bite.


[3/11/2023 6:43 AM] WMDM
At the same time another five spiders crawl through the gap in the wall.  You can see more behind them.


[4/11/2023 1:37 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer rushes in to Phan's side, swinging his mace at one of the spiders as his spectral hammer forms and swings toward the same spider.


[4/11/2023 1:55 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
after the first spider falls and seeing the bigger spiders enter the room Steve quickly marks one of the giant wolf spiders and sprays it with poison


[4/11/2023 9:19 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhanyaa brings a snowball down out of nowhere crushing one of the spiders and injurying the other.


[4/11/2023 9:20 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
She starts edging back towards the door they came through.  **"There's a lot of them."**


[4/11/2023 1:13 PM] Phan
Seeing the second spider he injured drop, Phan decides to keep going killing the next spider that the little sorcerer damaged. Taking one final swipe at another spider entering and misses. He looks to the others. **"Let's make a planned retreat. Steve and Dhan'ya get to the door and get it open. As soon as we are ready, we can make a hasty retreat. There's a lot more outside!"**


[4/11/2023 4:45 PM] WMDM
The spiders in the room shoot webs at nothing and bite the air.


[5/11/2023 5:39 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer continues to flail at the spiders merely cooling them with a gentle breeze

Steve starts to move back closer to the door, as he moves he sends an arrow in the direction of the giant spiders


[6/11/2023 12:22 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya stays with Steve moving back towards the door and firing off three magic missiles at each of the smaller spiders.


[6/11/2023 12:29 AM] Phan
Phan sees the 3 spiders that Dhan'ya hit with her spell and quickly dispatches them. Taking a swing at another, it dodges quickly. Turning to Hemmer he says, **"The others are at the door, let's get back there."** He then starts walking backwards towards the door.


[6/11/2023 12:30 AM] WMDM
As Phan turns to leave one of the spider's bites into his shoulder.  Another bites at Hemmer but misses.


[6/11/2023 12:35 AM] WMDM
Nearly a dozen more spiders swarm in through the gap one of them immediately taking a bite at Hemmer who manages to block it with his shield.


[6/11/2023 8:36 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer swings wildly as he backs up to the door "I'm right behind you Phan"


[6/11/2023 8:55 AM] WMDM
The spider's go for Hemmer as he moves to the door, but they slip on the rubble and pose no threat to him.


[6/11/2023 9:08 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve moves to the door and sends an arrow into one of the giant wolf spiders


[6/11/2023 9:09 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I feel like we have been set up here, we need to go"**


[6/11/2023 9:17 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya calls down flames on one of the smaller spiders through the doorway.


[6/11/2023 9:22 PM] Phan
As the group is through the door, he works with Hemmer to make sure it is closed right. **"Well, that was fun. Is everyone ok? I got a little bite, but thanks to your aid spell Dhan, I'm doing just fine. We need to figure this puzzle out of how to deal with a dozen or more spiders."**


[6/11/2023 11:28 PM] WMDM
Phan relocks the door without a problem, his previous unlocking leaving it in pristine condition.


[6/11/2023 11:30 PM] jvanblaricom0001
the spectral hammer drops out of sight as Hemmer starts a new incantation pointing to a piece of exposed metal. He continues to chant as it starts to glow red hot


[6/11/2023 11:35 PM] WMDM
Scratching sounds can be heard from behind the door as soon as it's closed and the door rattles a little but the lock holds fast.  The scratching continues.  As Hemmer heats the metal, the scratching slows, then stops.


[6/11/2023 11:39 PM] WMDM
Phan and Dhan'ya notice a few spiders moving away from the side of the building with the new hole in it.  They may have been the same ones that were in the building, or perhaps they never went it?  It's difficult to tell.


[6/11/2023 11:39 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer continues his chant for a full minute. "not sure whats on the other side of the door now, but its not going to be happy"


[6/11/2023 11:41 PM] Phan
**"Well, with that settled the best we can, shall we head to that next building?"** Phan points to the building passed the point of fence that they repaired previously.


[6/11/2023 11:44 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding. "It is probably best to keep moving. "


[6/11/2023 11:46 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya nods in agreement.  **"Well I hope that nice spider finds its way to the mountain safely."** she says with an unsure look of hope.


[6/11/2023 11:48 PM] Phan
Phan nods and starts to head to the next door and see if it is locked too.


[10/11/2023 6:53 AM] WMDM
As Phan touches the door handle the latch clicks as the door opens a crack.  Immediately the smell of stale and musty mildew.  Earthy tones overpower everything, but amongst the smell of decomposition it is mildly sweet.  The room seems dark and quiet.


[10/11/2023 6:56 AM] Phan
Phan looks to the others and nods as he takes a careful step in allowing his eyes to adjust to see what he can see and searches for a quick light switch.


[10/11/2023 7:08 AM] WMDM
As Phan enters the room the earthy smells only get stronger.  He reaches for the wall to find some sort of light source but instead finds the wall to be soft and moist.  Entirely unlike what a wall should feel like.  As his eyes adjust and the grey shadows of the room become clearer it looks like the room has become overrun with moss and fungus.  Debris is scattered around the edge of the room and in the  very middle of the room lies what looks like a tattered heavy leather backpack.


[10/11/2023 7:12 AM] Phan
Phan looks around the room.  Stepping forward turns over his shoulder and looks to the rest. **"It appears to be empty of people.  Bit overrun with decay. I see something curious in the middle that I want to check out. Anyone want to walk in with me?"**


[10/11/2023 7:13 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Looks like no-one has cleaned up in here for years."** Dhan'ya says with a look of concern as she steps in afte Phan.


[10/11/2023 7:43 AM] Phan
Phan looks towards the center of the room and seeing the backpack there he begins walking towards the backpack with a narrow focus full of curiosity.


[10/11/2023 10:55 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Walking into the room, "Its impressive that the mold could take a cement room like this."


[10/11/2023 10:56 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"Careful Phan, why not use the spear to move that bag"


[10/11/2023 11:51 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"can you hear anything moving around in there?"**


[11/11/2023 1:16 AM] WMDM
As Phan creeps stealthily to the backpack his paw suddenly goes through what should be solid ground as though the concrete floor has rotted away a few inches.  As he does so an almost imperceptible puff of spores is ejected into the air that smells like death and hopelessness.


[15/11/2023 7:20 AM] WMDM
As Dhan'ya, Hemmer, and Phan breath in the spores they recognise this as a place of death and decay and something about it chills them to their core.


[15/11/2023 6:32 PM] WMDM
Three shots of spider's web appear from the darkness one missing Phan the other hitting him and one wrapping Dhan'ya in place again.


[15/11/2023 6:33 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya tries to pulls the web off managing only to get her hand stuck to it.  Meanwhile she draws a dagger and incants words of divine power bathing almost the entire room in light and showing the three spiders hiding against the wall.


[17/11/2023 2:34 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Upon seeing the creatures Hemmer lashes out with a spell filling the room with the sound of a tolling bell.


[17/11/2023 9:09 PM] Phan
Phan starts teaching for the backpack but the fear overtakes him just as the web hits. He tries to break free of the web but his mind is too preoccupied with the discomfort of fear preventing him from effectively doing anything to the web.


[18/11/2023 9:17 PM] WMDM
Spider's web shoots out entangling Hemmer as the other two spider's move forward and bite at Phan and Dhan'ya.  Only Phan is able to dodge the bite.


[20/11/2023 8:08 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
seeing the spiders running towards he friends Steve hastily sends an arrow past them


[21/11/2023 12:29 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Sod this."** Dhan'ya says grumpily after getting more entangled in the webbing.  She looks behind Steve and misty steps there leaving a small aasimar shaped pile of webbing to crumple to the ground.


[22/11/2023 1:24 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer breaks free of the webs, wanting to rush to Phans side but unable to.


[22/11/2023 9:41 PM] Phan
Phan fights through the fear and lashes out at one of the spiders as his only option that his fear addled mind could see as a viable option. Thankfully he was able to kill one of the odd looking spiders as he struggles against the webbing.


[22/11/2023 10:26 PM] WMDM
Leaving Phan webbed, the remaining two spiders rush the rest of the party, biting ineffectively against their armour.


[24/11/2023 10:16 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
after the spider tried to bite him Steve let's out a gurgling roar and sends acid all over it


[24/11/2023 10:23 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Get 'em boys!"**


[24/11/2023 10:23 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya fires off a few missiles to weaken the spiders.


[24/11/2023 11:46 PM] Phan
Phan finally breaks free of the webbing. Looking around, there's something that is just not feeling right so he gets back with the group.


[27/11/2023 8:52 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve holds his hand up to send a noxious cloud of poison around the thing in front of him, but not being completely sure what it is he losses concentration and barely sends a fluf out past it


[27/11/2023 12:23 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
Dhan'ya produce some sacred flame that sounds the remaining spider and gently roasts it, leaving it slightly charred and looking worse for wear.


[28/11/2023 10:24 AM] WMDM
With a few final blows the last spider stops moving and crumples into the ground lifelessly.


[28/11/2023 10:28 AM] WMDM
Now that the threat is gone and with Dhan'ya dagger lighting up the room everything seems less frightening.  (No-one is frightened anymore)  Taking a closer look at the spiders you see they are covered in a mottled coat of fungal growths, their legs resembling twisted roots.


[28/11/2023 10:28 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"What in the world is this? I've never seen anything like it"


[28/11/2023 10:31 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"are they real spiders or made to look like spiders?"** Steve questions the team


[28/11/2023 10:32 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Whatever it is, it gives me the creeps."** Dhan'ya says, a visible shiver going down her spine.  **"Certainly not something that my gods would have made."**


[28/11/2023 10:37 AM] WMDM
Looking around the room Hemmer notices the position of where the spiders came from vaguely remind him of a hammer and anvil striking where the bag lies in the middle of the room.


[28/11/2023 10:38 AM] WMDM
The spider's seem to be some sort of amalgamation of arachnid and fungus.  However it's not clear if the fungus is growing on them or is inherently a part of them.


[28/11/2023 10:41 AM] jvanblaricom0001
walking closer to the bag. Kneeling down and looking closer. "the bugs and the fungus are intertwined some how"


[28/11/2023 10:49 AM] WMDM
Steve can tell the spiders have been here for a while.  At least a few weeks based on the amount of fungus and mould growing.  There is no evidence they were co-oerced into the building, but the Dragonborn does notice some scuff marks that could indicate the bag was recently dragged in from the main door, most likely by the spiders themselves.


[28/11/2023 10:52 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"what ever these things are they have been in here for a bit, but I think they put that bag there."** Steve says as he looks around the room, **"is there anything in there?"**


[28/11/2023 11:00 AM] jvanblaricom0001
reaching out slowly toward the bag. and tipping it over onto the ground


[28/11/2023 3:26 PM] WMDM
The bag seems full and suitably heavy, but the contents doesn't tip out readily and seems lodged inside.  A few loose pebbles and a twig drop out though.


[29/11/2023 4:58 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer looks into the bag, and reaches in slowly


[29/11/2023 5:16 AM] Phan
Phan holds back a bit still suffering effects from the fear... not sure what caused it.


[29/11/2023 7:49 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve walks over to the bag, draws his short sword and uses the tip to open up the bag and have a look **"well let's see what's in here then"**


[29/11/2023 8:07 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"Watch that sword my arm is in there"


[29/11/2023 8:07 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Not looking up from the opening of the bag


[29/11/2023 5:54 PM] WMDM
Opening the bag and reaching inside Hemmer' find a bunch of rocks and sticks, stuck together and to the inside of the bag with more webbing.


[29/11/2023 11:38 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Pulling his hand out.  "Its webbed together rocks and sticks"


[29/11/2023 11:42 PM] Phan
Phan pauses his thinking looking at Hemmer. "Are you saying it's was a trap? These spiders are seeming more and more intelligent as we go."


[29/11/2023 11:45 PM] WMDM
As Hemmer pulls out his hand, he notices a scrap of paper wedged underneath the rocks and sticks in the bag.


[29/11/2023 11:45 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"Yeah.  I didn't know spiders got this big, let alone this smart.  The sooner we can be done with this the better."**


[29/11/2023 11:51 PM] Phan
Phan nods to Dhan'ya. **"Agreed.  Hopefully we will clear this place soon and be able to head back to town.  I'm not sure this is an experience I would like to relive any time soon."** Looking to the group.  **"How are we all feeling? I'm a little winded after two fights in a row, but I think I can keep going. Though a quick rest wouldn't hurt either."**


[29/11/2023 11:53 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"I could keep going, but lets get out of this awful place shall we?"**


[29/11/2023 11:54 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"agreed, is that everything cleared now?"**


[30/11/2023 12:56 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer pulls out the paper looking to see what if anything is on it.


[30/11/2023 12:57 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"This was in the bottom"


[30/11/2023 2:53 AM] Phan
Phan turns to Hemmer.  **"Bring it over so we can all take a look."**


[30/11/2023 2:57 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Standing up and showing the paper to the others


[30/11/2023 10:15 PM] WMDM
The paper is half a torn map of a city.  In the top left in bold letters it says **IPSWICH** and it looks like a detailed account of every street and corner.  However it has also been drawn over with many additions and 'corrections' by hand.


[1/12/2023 10:21 PM] Phan
Phan scratches his head at the map not really understanding it. **"Well, that's a puzzle to look into later.  Does anyone need a short sit to recuperate or should we head to the final building from that map?  Knowing that each building we've entered has NOT been safe, I'm not sure I will trust what that map in the office said. So we should be prepared for anything."**


[1/12/2023 11:48 PM] jvanblaricom0001
"if a short break is what is needed we can wait. I am in no need of a break yet"


[2/12/2023 12:53 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer 3)
**"I'll keep going.  Come on, let's get out of here if you're done with the bag."** Dhan'ya walks back out the door and unfolds the map to the complex again.


[2/12/2023 12:54 AM] Phan
Phan peeks at the room one more time and shivers, then turning to head out the door. **"Let's definitely get out of here."**

[2/12/2023 12:56 AM] Phan
Phan looks at the map that Dhan'ya pulls out real quick. **"Yeah, I guess it won't hurt much to look in the first building.  Better to know it's clear then to have something come in behind us when we go to that last building."**

nodding, "We really don't want any of these things sneaking up on us


[2/12/2023 3:40 AM] Phan
Phan nods. **"Well then, let's head to the next building."** Phan starts to wander to the next building while trying to keep an eye out through the fences to see if there's any signs of other large spiders.


[3/12/2023 9:33 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve has one last look of wounder at the room and then walks out behind the others, **"this place just seems to keep getting stranger and stranger"**


[4/12/2023 2:28 PM] jvanblaricom0001
"it is an odd place. I think it was meant as a sort of dungeon for holding prisoners." Shaking his head at the thought of the need for a place so big for that reason.


[6/12/2023 7:03 AM] WMDM
The track to the penultimate building is relatively uneventful.  The spiders you can see outside don't seem to have noticed you or seem interested in seeking you out.  A few back near the fence are spinning new webs, reaching out towards the forest.

Reaching the room you find the door unlocked, and as you nudge the door open, a gust of slightly musty air wafts out. Sunlight spills through makeshift curtains, casting a warm glow on the interior. The walls, painted in faded hues of blue and yellow, display vibrant drawings of basic arithmetic and charming stick figures holding quills.

A collection of mismatched desks fills the room, each adorned with scribbles and doodles. The chalkboard at the front, although smudged, still bears remnants of a lesson on basic survival tips.  In one corner, a slightly wobbly wooden lectern stands proudly, supporting a worn notebook.  A few colourful crayons lie scattered nearby, seemingly waiting for someone to pick them up and continue the lesson.

The desks, rather than being in orderly rows, are arranged in a casual circle, suggesting a cooperative and communal atmosphere. The atmosphere in the room is strangely cozy, a stark contrast to the harshness of the landscape transformed by the spiders outside.


[6/12/2023 7:21 AM] WMDM
Phan makes a tour around the room checking the windows and they all seem secure.  There's no obvious means of entry.


[6/12/2023 10:38 PM] Phan
Phan stops by one of the desks and picks up a blue writing implement and scribbles on a desk saying *Phan was here*.  Getting back to the door he tells everyone, **"The room looks pretty clear to me. Seems like this was a place for meetings. It's a bit strange to me, but it makes sense. If you want to look around too, feel free, otherwise I will suggest we check that last room and deal with that and then maybe see what can be done with all the spiders on the outside."**


[7/12/2023 3:19 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"Lets keep moving.  No reason to let anything get set to ambush us"


[7/12/2023 11:20 PM] Phan
Phan heads back out the door and towards the last building carefully checking the door to see if it is locked.


[9/12/2023 12:43 AM] WMDM
The door is closed and seems to have a lock.  Gently turning the handle however doesn't manage to open the door.


[9/12/2023 12:59 AM] WMDM
Phan is able, however, to hear faint scratching and tapping noises beyond the door.


[9/12/2023 1:01 AM] Phan
Phan turns to the others.  **"Ummm... I'm not sure if this is really a safe room anymore.  I believe we should still go in and clear it.  If we want to do this the right way, we should clear it all and try to make it safe for people to return and get back to work."**


[9/12/2023 8:45 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya nods.  **"We should finish the job while we're here.  Can you open the lock Phan?"**


[9/12/2023 8:50 AM] Phan
Phan nods and pulls out his lock picks and tries to unlock the door.


[9/12/2023 8:55 AM] Phan
Phan looks at the lock and remembers the last two locks. **"This is another rudimentary lock and should only take a second."** After a couple quick flicks of his wrist the tumblers all fall into place and the door shows signs of being loose.


[12/12/2023 6:51 AM] WMDM
As the heavy door creaks open, a waft of damp air mixed with an unmistakable musky odor assaults your senses. The room beyond is dimly lit, the feeble light struggling to penetrate the thick layers of webbing that stretch across the collapsed middle of the chamber. Survivors, a forlorn looking group, huddled together in the far corner behind robust metal bars, cast fearful glances about the room.

Numerous giant spiders wander aimlessly through the expansive nest. The middle of the room has collapsed into a pit, obscured by a mess of interwoven silk. In the heart of this pit, a colossal spider of unusual girth sits lazily, its legs outstretched and its abdomen swollen.

The ceiling, looking precarious at best, sheds flakes of concrete with every subtle movement. Off to the side, a portion crumbles and falls to the ground below. The very air seems heavy with tension, and you can't shake the feeling that any sudden move could disturb the delicate balance of the spider's nest.


[13/12/2023 9:25 PM] WMDM
Glistening silk threads stretch across the chamber like an intricate tapestry, creating a lattice.  Steve's animalistic intuition tell him all he needs to know and Hemmer doesn't miss a detail ||He catches sight of an animal, perhaps a pig suspended from the lattice by silken threads. The spiders move with purpose, deftly wrapping their prey in a cocoon-like bundle.  This appears for all intents and purposes to be a food storage chamber.||  Hemmer also notices ||Overhead some of the spiders are clinging to the ceiling that looks almost ready to collapse.  Over near the survivors it seems a few spiders are actively working at the cells the survivors are huddling in, to pull the metal door of it's hinges.||
Then as Hemmer and Steve lean a little further into the room the door gives a *creak* and draws the attention of half the spiders.


[14/12/2023 1:02 PM] Phan
Phan turns to the group. **"Well, shall we?"** Phan starts to rub the outline of a tattoo on his arms looking for the signal to head in.


[14/12/2023 1:05 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"now or never"**


[15/12/2023 12:26 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Pointing up to the ceiling "there's more up there, and it looks unsteady"


[15/12/2023 1:19 AM] WMDM
One of the giant spiders near the cell door gets a grip on it and shakes it mightily, the bars creaking with the spiders strength.


[15/12/2023 1:33 AM] WMDM
The huge spider in the middle of the room moves back, black and green eyes observing you.  A spider rushes forward and catches Steve is it's web while another scurries along the ceiling and fires at Hemmer but misses.


[15/12/2023 1:38 AM] Phan
Phan finishes touching his tattoo and it quickly darkens giving off a slight shadowing haze around them. He then quickly sneaks passed Hemmer and Steve to attack the spider that just came to view in the door. Just as he takes his quick stabs with his spear he notices another giant spider shifting and focusing on him just to his right which distracts him causing him to miss.


[15/12/2023 1:54 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer looks at the 3 closest spiders and calls out a spell, before moving to flank a spider with Phan


[17/12/2023 5:17 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve puts up his hand towards the spider at the door and hits it with a poisonous cloud of gas to little to no effect


[17/12/2023 2:33 PM] WMDM
Webs fly everywhere, mostly missing their mark, but Hemmer is tagged with some and another spider runs up to bite him, missing.  The spiders at the back continue to rattle the door while the survivors move back.  Four of the better prepared survivors stay closer to the door looking like they're ready to defend the others if it comes to it.


[17/12/2023 2:51 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya casts a spell and the area is flooded with sparkling glittering specters that flit around and attack the spiders.


[17/12/2023 11:28 PM] Phan
Phan quickly lashes out with his spear at one of the injured spiders in front of him, killing it. He takes a swipe at the other spider next to him but it straightens its legs causing the spear to go under the abdomen.


[20/12/2023 2:11 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer struggles to break free but fails.


[20/12/2023 8:09 PM] WMDM
Another of the spiders starts to crawl toward the party but collapses as soon as the Spirit Guardians attack it.


[20/12/2023 11:00 PM] Phan
Phan quickly dispatches the spider in front of him after the handiwork of Dhan'ya's specters and with a bolt of feline agility makes it to the spiders trying to get into the door to help distract them from trying to get the survivors.  Upon arriving by the spiders he takes a stab and a few more swipes at the first spider in front of the door watching it drop and prepares for the repercussions of the second.


[21/12/2023 1:36 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer breaks free of the webs bringing his mace and shield up


[21/12/2023 10:48 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve rips him self free with the spiders crowding the door he marks the one at the back ready to attack


[21/12/2023 10:50 PM] WMDM
The other spider at the door finally finds the weak spot and tears the door off it's hinges, scuttling past Phan to get into where the survivors are cowering.


[21/12/2023 10:53 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya calls down divine flame scorching the bloated spider's body slightly.


[21/12/2023 10:58 PM] WMDM
The bloated spider scuttles to the side and spits and line of acid at the group at the door splashing it over all of them.


[21/12/2023 11:11 PM] Phan
Phan takes a stab at the giant spider as it zips passed him into the area with the survivors, striking true. Unable to move this turn after his burst of energy last turn quickly whips out 2 darts throwing them at the spider that is in with the survivors missing with the first and hitting a weak spot with the second causing it to also drop right in front of a group of survivors before it can take a bite.


[22/12/2023 2:37 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer calls forth a glowing bolt launching toward the big spider only to have it go wide.


[30/12/2023 12:40 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya moves away from Hemmer in case another line of acid comes out of the Bloated spider and launches a few magic bolts at it.


[30/12/2023 12:41 AM] WMDM
The spider follows Steve's movement and spits more acid at him which he manages to avoid to worst of.


[30/12/2023 1:43 AM] Phan
Phan's ears pick up sounds above him. He quickly moves in front of the door to help protect the citizens and fires off 2 darts hitting the big spider with one of them. He then looks to the others and says, **"I think we've got company incoming! Do what you can to this guy as soon as we can."**


[30/12/2023 12:12 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer tries the spell again.  Sending the bolt of energy at the spider hitting it squarely.  Then he moves to get some space from the others. "We're working on it.  That thing is tough"


[1/01/2024 2:02 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve holds his hand out towards the spider and sends a cloud of gas over the top of the spider as it site in its hole


[2/01/2024 12:54 PM] WMDM
The unsettling symphony of skittering grows louder and three more giant spiders descend with predatory grace from the ceiling into the room. The survivors, already on edge, tighten their huddled formation.  In the corner, the ceiling suddenly succumbs to the weathering and weight from above.  Crumbling away with a thunderous crash another giant spider plummets through the void, landing with a disquieting thud right beside the cowering survivors.


[2/01/2024 1:17 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya launches snowballs at two of the new spiders then positions herself behind Steve.  **"I'm out of spells!"** She says desperately.  **"Phan the survivors in the cage."** she says hoping he's seen the danger to them.


[2/01/2024 1:19 PM] WMDM
One of the new spiders launches webs past Steve and the Bloated Spider crawls out of his pit to threaten the dragonborn even as it's attacked by Dhan'ya guardians.


[2/01/2024 1:49 PM] Phan
Phan looks passed the survivors hearing Dhan'ya's warning. **"I'm on it!"** Phan takes off with a burst of speed making it in front of the spider in the caged area. He quickly takes to jabs with his spear, striking true and killing it. Turning to the survivors he says, **"huddle with the guards over there and I will do everything I can to keep you safe too."**


[2/01/2024 1:58 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer unleashes another blast at the big spider.  "That was the last spell.  We are going to have to make a run for it soon"


[4/01/2024 6:18 PM] WMDM
Two of the new spiders throw webs, neatly capturing Steve and Hemmer.  The survivors rush to the other end of the now-far-less-secure area, changing places with those who are lightly armed.


[4/01/2024 6:22 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya rushes around Steve to try to position her guardians across the new spiders and tries to help him, with the webs?  With an attack?  Who knows.


[4/01/2024 10:32 PM] Phan
Phan moves with the survivors closer to the guards and quickly fires off 2 darts through the bars towards the big spider in the center of the room and one of the darts finds its mark.


[4/01/2024 11:37 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer struggles against the webs to no avail.  "Not going be much help for the moment "


[4/01/2024 11:39 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"yeah in a bit of a sticky situation here as well"** Steve fighting against what seems an endless web


[5/01/2024 12:56 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
After helping Steve get free of the webs, Dhan'ya moves closer to where Hemmer is still trapped, throwing a dagger at the spider attacking him along the way.


[5/01/2024 10:35 PM] Phan
Phan sticks near the survivors to be sure to help protect them should any more surprises show up and quickly throws 2 more darts at the Big spider in the center of the room. The first dart finds its target but just as the second dart is about to hit the spider shifts and it goes passed one of its legs.


[5/01/2024 11:36 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer wriggles free of the webs, and hunkers behind his shield.


[7/01/2024 8:14 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve makes a short dash away from the spider and sends an arrow towards the spider but misses drastically


[7/01/2024 8:30 AM] WMDM
THe spider's turn their attention to Dhan'ya in the middle of the room covering her with webs.


[7/01/2024 11:22 AM] Phan
Seeing his team struggling Phan turns to the survivors. **"We are going to do our best to get you all out of here."** He then bolts full speed down to get in range of the big spider on the center grabbing tight on his spear he takes two thrusts. Seeing it drop on the first hit, he takes a second strike to be sure it is down.


[7/01/2024 12:27 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer swings widely at the giant spider in front of him


[7/01/2024 8:28 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve moves over near his team mates and launces an arrow to the remaining spider landing it deep into its body


[9/01/2024 12:53 AM] Phan
A little tired from his previous run down to the big spider, Phan heads towards the giant spider harrowing Hemmer and takes 2 more swings with his spear. Hitting with the first he is a little tired and misses with the second.


[9/01/2024 1:00 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer notices the others aiding him and with renewed vigor he lands a solid blow to the spider spraying its ichor as it crumples.


[9/01/2024 1:02 AM] jvanblaricom0001
""Please tell me there aren't more""


[9/01/2024 1:04 AM] WMDM
As the final spider falls and the party looks around for any other threats there is a loud silence, then the survivors let up a little cheer, until one of them shushes them saying **"There might be more."** They slowly file out of the secure area and meet the party.  A rugged older looking canine speaks to you **"Thank you so much.  We were about to be done for I'm sure.  If you lot hadn't shown up...  Well I don't like to think."**


[9/01/2024 1:09 AM] Phan
**"Glad we were able to help.  Now looking at the state of this building, I would suggest you head to the office to get safe.  We already have one gentleman there.  Maybe you could escort them Dhan'ya and make sure they make it to the room safely?  I'm going to look around this room to see if I can find out anything."**


[9/01/2024 1:10 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"Are there more survivors? We should be looking for?"


[9/01/2024 1:12 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer walks with Phan as he looks through the room.  " if we are looking at another fight, I'm going to need some time."


[9/01/2024 1:12 AM] WMDM
**"Good good.  Yes.  The main building is still secure then?  The attack happened so fast we just rushed to our nearest safe room.  I don't know how the others fared.  But it's... Yes it's been a week, we can ask the book."**  The other survivors look at him and nod their head in agreement.


[9/01/2024 1:12 AM] jvanblaricom0001
"Ask the book?"


[9/01/2024 1:13 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
**"I'm glad we made it in time.  Are any of you injured?"**


[9/01/2024 1:14 AM] WMDM
**"Yes the book will answer the question.  As long as it's still intact.  You didn't happen to see how the school room was did you?"** He looks around. **"I think we've all managed to escape injury thank you my dear.  Just tired and hungry for now."**


[9/01/2024 1:14 AM] Phan
**"The school room, that's the building closest to us?  It seemed to be in good repair still."**


[9/01/2024 1:15 AM] WMDM
The canine looks relieved.  **"Well then we should go there first."**


[9/01/2024 1:16 AM] Phan
**"Dhan'ya can you walk them over there and help them find anything of value while Hemmer and I finish looking over this room?"**


[9/01/2024 1:16 AM] WMDM
He starts for the door, still looking around cautiously at the ceilings as if more spiders are going to descend at any minute.


[9/01/2024 1:17 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
**"Of course Phan.  Let's go everyone.  You're safe now!  Safer anyway.  I suppose still be cautious."** She says, trying to lift their spirits.


[9/01/2024 1:19 AM] WMDM
Phan and Hemmer hang back to investigate, but they do not find anything surprising.  They can surmise that the bloated spider in the middle of the room led to the collapse of the ceiling and the rest of the spiders took advantage of the situation.  It looks like it happened recently and the ceiling is still precarious in places.


[9/01/2024 1:21 AM] Phan
Turning to Hemmer, **"Well... I was hoping for something to tell us where these spiders are coming from but since there's nothing here, let's follow quickly to the school building and see if there's any help we can give there.  We can rest up once we get back to the office area.  Do you want a potion to help with your injuries?"**


[9/01/2024 1:31 AM] jvanblaricom0001
" if we have time to rest and recharge that would be better. If we are getting into another fight I'll take a potion, but its probably better to save them"


[9/01/2024 1:33 AM] Phan
Phan nods. **"Then lets catch up to the rest and we can recouperate while we are in the office."**


[9/01/2024 1:35 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding and picking up the pace a bit to catch up with the others


[9/01/2024 10:01 AM] WMDM
While Phan and Hemmer scour the room for clues, Steve looks at the spiders.  His ranger experience tells him that the massive bloated one in the middle seems unnatural, but there's no indication of what has caused it to be the way it is.


[9/01/2024 11:34 AM] WMDM
> The track to the penultimate building is relatively uneventful.  The spiders you can see outside don't seem to have noticed you ...
@WMDM (@Big Jim (DM): Dhan'ya Syl Kher) - [jump](<https://discord.com/channels/@me/1085381989361786980/1181702468300722337>)
 The room the canine leads you to is as before.


[9/01/2024 11:41 AM] WMDM
He moves swiftly over to the lectern and opens the worn notebook.  **"Ahh.  Hello Chuck.  It's been a while now.  Do you have a question?"** A voice with a strange accent seems to come from the pages of the book itself.  The canine, apparently Chuck, responds with urgency.  **"Yes Book.  Where are all the residents of this outpost?"**  There is a pause, then the book speaks again.  **"Most are in this room.  Henry is in the main structure near the front of the complex.  Those who travelled to Brisbandit to escape the spiders are no longer residents.  There are... less than before."**


[9/01/2024 1:08 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya moves over to look at the book.  **"It talks!  Incredible.  What are you?"** she asks the book.


[9/01/2024 1:14 PM] WMDM
**"Oh ho!  Miss Dhan'ya.  Getting right to the point I see.  You aren't one to beat around the bush with your divine heritage giving you all the confidence you need.  A shame you don't know where you really came from though, and now you've used your question asking about me rather than you!  What am I is complex, so it's probably better that you asked me rather than Chuck as he's never quite got it."** The book starts.  Chuck frowns at the books comment but says nothing.  The book continues **"I'm a spirit, you'd probably think of me like a Fae but I'm not from the Wilds, never was.  I'm just content to stay here in this book answering questions.  So I think that about sums it up."**


[9/01/2024 1:15 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya listens with interest, her brows furrowing as the book describes her. **"I see you know much.  You said, my question, does that mean you'll only answer the one?"**


[9/01/2024 1:16 PM] WMDM
**"Whether I answer your second question or not, you'll know the answer."** the book says and chuckles a little.


[9/01/2024 1:30 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"you seem to know alot about all that is, and about this place. where did these spiders come from and why?"**


[9/01/2024 1:44 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer sits back watching the interplay between the book and the others.


[9/01/2024 2:19 PM] Phan
Phan walks up to the book and looks around it trying to figure out where the voice is coming from.


[9/01/2024 2:22 PM] WMDM
**"Ahh Steve the warrior.  You're interested in beasts as these ones do not seem to be behaving as normal.  It's so strange.  They've come from the west, from the forest around the town there.  Oh yes.  Some from in the town, underneath it, yes.  As for why?  Well, I'm not sure you were listening to how many questions you get answered.  Saying them in one breath doesn't make them the same question now does it?"**


[9/01/2024 2:23 PM] WMDM
One of the armed canines steps forward.  **"Are we safe here?  Are there more..."** He stops mid-way through his second question realising the futility of it."**


[9/01/2024 2:24 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Careful there Phan, we all know how curious you can be"**


[9/01/2024 2:25 PM] WMDM
**"You are safe, though not as safe as you were when this place had solid ceiling and walls.  But what does safe really mean?  Anything could happen and as you know I only know what is, not what is to come."** the book replies to the canine.


[9/01/2024 2:28 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
**"So the book seems to only answer one question?"** Dhan'ya asks Chuck.


[9/01/2024 2:30 PM] WMDM
Chuck nods.  **"One question per person per month.  Don't know why, but that's it's rule.  It's helped us set up this place right nice, and it's certainly helped with teaching the kids and such.  Like it said, it won't tell us the future so we didn't see this attack coming."**


[9/01/2024 2:32 PM] WMDM
Hemmer has no doubt the voice is emanating from the book it self.  There is clearly nothing underneath it producing the sound.


[9/01/2024 2:34 PM] WMDM
Steve get a good feel for whatever this entity is.  There's no deception in it's voice and it seems to take genuine pleasure in sharing the answers to the questions.  It does seem to feel a pang of guilt not answering follow-up questions, but it seems as if it's skirting the edges of some contract or other that makes it answer the way it does.


[9/01/2024 2:39 PM] WMDM
As Phan looks at the pages of the book he notices the pages are blank.  Ink seem to appear and swirl and form characters as it speaks, but the language is unknown to him and he blinks, the words are gone.


[9/01/2024 2:40 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
**"This doesn't make any sense to me.  Whatever it is, I'm not sure if we should trust it or not."**


[9/01/2024 2:44 PM] Phan
Phan looks to the others from his group and asks them, **"Should we go rest and think of the questions to ask that could hopefully solve the question of the source of this spider infestation?"**


[9/01/2024 2:55 PM] WMDM
**"Yes."** The book says simply.  There is a moment of silence then it chortles.  **"I'm just teasing you.  That doesn't count, I know you weren't asking me."**


[10/01/2024 3:07 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Laughing **"good to know it has a sense of humor"**


[10/01/2024 3:09 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Shifting his mace and shield to the side as he starts to remove his armor.  **" I could use a good nights sleep. "**


[10/01/2024 3:21 AM] Phan
Phan nods to Hemmer**"Well, let's take Book back to the office if they are amenable to that and rest up there. I believe we did a good job securing the upstairs as well so there will be more room to spread out if we need and decide what to do from here. Chuck, you seem to know Book the best for the time being. Have you moved them before?"** Phan carefully makes sure to not address the book with a question, just in case he needs to use his question to help get answers.


[10/01/2024 6:29 AM] WMDM
Chuck looks starteled for a moment. **"Oh no no.  The book doesn't move.  It's made that very clear.  Stays in this room.  Something about the ambience or something."** The books voice comes next.  **"Aww Chuck.  You remembered.  You DO care."**  Chuck clears his throat and looks uncomfortable.  **"Anyway.  I'd like to see how Henry is doing so lets get going to the office then."**


[10/01/2024 6:46 AM] Phan
Phan nods and turns to the book.  **"Well Book, we shall leave you to your location then and come talk to you after we've had a chance to recuperate our minds and bodies."** He then turns to the others and says, *""Ok, let's go check on Henry."** Phan turns back out the door and starts heading back to the office.


[10/01/2024 12:53 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer shifts to stand up gathers his gear and follows Phan.  **"Phan that makes me  wonder if it's a preference or it's tied to the location. "**


[10/01/2024 12:55 PM] Phan
Phan nods as they are walking out. **"Maybe if we think it through, someone can ask more about itself later."**


[10/01/2024 12:57 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I have a feeling it doesn't like answering questions about itself"**


[11/01/2024 9:23 PM] WMDM
The office and main structure seem sound and the repairs seem to have held up.  Henry is wandering around sort books on shelves and sweeping small piles of dirt into big piles of dirt.  Chuck greets him and Henry looks surprised but smiles with relief.  The rest of the survivors start spreading throughout the building, obviously at home in the familiar surroundings and feeling a bit safer now.


[11/01/2024 11:48 PM] Phan
Phan settles in looking to Chuck and Henry. **"I'm glad to see the relief in your eyes. Please feel free to catch up with each other.  I know this was a harrowing experience for everyone.  As you can see, some of us are a little exhausted or beat down.** *nodding towards Hemmer* **I hope you won't mind if we continue talking about everything after we've had a chance to rest and recuperate"**


[12/01/2024 2:01 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer finds himself a corner and lays out his bedroll.  Taking his armor off and using a bit of magic to mend the damage caused by the spiders.  **"Im not the most nature oriented guy but I've never heard of spiders spitting acid like that"**


[12/01/2024 6:14 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"something was definitely off about that big one as well, not just its size but everything"** Steve clears a spot near the wall and takes a seat


[12/01/2024 6:28 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya clearly also tired, makes rounds making sure everyone is ok.  **"I agree.  If there is something or someone behind this then someone needs to go and stop them."**


[12/01/2024 6:31 AM] WMDM
Some of the locals do a check of the building while an older female canine produces cooking utensils and suddenly the smell of stew fills the area.  An hour later she dishes it up to the locals and gives extra portions to the adventurers who saved them.  With their stomaches full everyone seems content to catch a good night's rest.


[12/01/2024 6:34 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya tries to help with the serving of the food but is summarily told she'll be eating with everyone else.  Dhan'ya insists, but after some gentle reprimanding from the elderly matriach about how a guest should behave she sits down and enjoys her stew with a look of guilty pleasure on her face.


[12/01/2024 6:41 AM] Phan
Phan thanks everyone for the food and welcome and walks to an empty spot spreading out in meditation then quickly falls asleep.


[17/01/2024 7:11 AM] WMDM
The night passes without incident. As dawn breaks, a muted tranquility blankets the makeshift outpost. The survivors, nestled within the converted prison, stir from their restful slumber. Chuck and Henry are awake sharing a quiet conversation, their words laden with the relief of unexpected reunions.  Henry seems less agitated now, still obviosly not entirely coherent, but the tension and anxiety has gone. The survivors, feeling a newfound sense of security, embark on familiar routines, tidying up and organizing the space.  The stew is refreshed and reheated and the aroma of food begins to waft through the compound again.


[17/01/2024 7:13 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
The small aasimar yawns and stretches as she awakes.  **"I slept much better last night."** she says through another yawn.


[17/01/2024 7:16 AM] Phan
Phan wakes and stretches into a meditative pose and looks over to his companions. **"We were so exhausted that we didn't get to talk much about questions for the book.  I'm not sure wheat might be the best to ask.  Maybe a source of the spiders or the name of someone who is controlling them?  Maybe how that one spider got so large?  We should also do one more sweep of the place to try and make sure we have all the spiders cleared out"**


[17/01/2024 7:21 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer lays still and keeps his eyes closed as he speaks, **"The first question would have to be are the spiders being controlled, then one of us would ask the follow up question about who. Or we have to line up the folk that live here and give them each a question, with someone writing down the answers and adjusting questions "**


[18/01/2024 12:50 AM] Phan
Phan ponders a moment and turns to one of the survivors nearby. **" I've seen big spiders in the past in some of my travels, but nothing to this level.  Is this a normal occurrence where you came from to have spiders like this? If this is normal, I would say asking about control is silly... however if this level of giant spiders is not normal or natural, we definitely have to look more into the cause."**


[18/01/2024 12:55 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"the first time I fought spiders like this was out at the Giant Peanut, the locals there said this wasn't normal to them"**


[18/01/2024 12:59 AM] Phan
Phan turns towards Hemmer. **"Well, in that case it seems unnatural.  I would assume then that there is a controlling factor. Maybe the first question could be something about 'What is controlling or commanding all these spiders to venture into the town area.' to which if it is a humanoid, we can then follow up with maybe who/where?  I have not asked a question, so I would be willing to ask that first question of Book."**


[18/01/2024 1:03 AM] jvanblaricom0001
++"might have started out as an abundance of food, but they seem too organized.  The ones we fought the first time weren't this organized."++


[18/01/2024 6:40 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve gets up hearing the comption, and grabs some more food **"I think we can go 2 ways about this, either try and find out who is doing it, or where they are comming from. then tack them down and see what's happening there."** he sits down with the party and enjoys the left overs


[19/01/2024 6:26 AM] WMDM
Hearing the question Chuck comes over **"Yeah no.  This is new to us mate.  I mean sure we've always had the nasty critters around, but this wa a thriving little community before the spiders trashed the place.  Now listen not everyone's time is up for the book yet and some people are pretty touchy about getting their own personal question but I'll see if I can rustle up a few who can help you out."**


[19/01/2024 6:30 AM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya goes with Chuck as he talks to the others.  They return a few minutes later.  **"We've found six who are willing to share their question for the greater good."** Dhan'ya says and gives Chuck's arm an excited squeeze of reassurance.  **"Don't worry.  We'll find out who or what's behind this and make sure they don't bother you again."**


[19/01/2024 6:31 AM] Phan
Phan smiles excitedly at the news. **"Wonderful!  Do we do that now or should we scout to make sure everything is still safe and see if there are any more giant spiders in this area?"**


[19/01/2024 7:55 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I think we should do one more quick scout through, let these people have a bit more time to gather them selves"**


[19/01/2024 12:00 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I am a bit concerned that if we don't move forward with the book, we may lose out on the good will of the people"**


[19/01/2024 6:52 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya nods.  **"All good points.  But what are we going to do?  Perhaps compromise and just check the paths near the school room?"**


[19/01/2024 7:01 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"sounds good, just check corridors and fences, check for any close activity"**


[19/01/2024 11:04 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Sitting up, **"sounds like a good plan"**


[19/01/2024 11:13 PM] Phan
Phan nods. **"Yeah, we should make sure that door is secure from that last building and maybe post someone up at the door while we are in there to watch our backs.  Maybe someone that already asked the question?"**


[19/01/2024 11:18 PM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"I can stay I blew my questions already"**


[19/01/2024 11:19 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya nods.  **"Me too.  Let me know how I can help."**


[22/01/2024 10:38 PM] Phan
Phan looks to Dhan'ya. **"Miss Dhan'ya and Mr. Hemmer, can you help gather those 6 that are willing to help and meet us at the Book? I'm thinking Steve and I can run ahead quick and just verify that door is secure on that last building and then head back to the book. We can start with our questions as soon as we are all together."**


[23/01/2024 12:38 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding and getting his armor on.  **"I dont know about anyone else, but Im tired of these spiders"***


[23/01/2024 6:18 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
"sounds good, if all seems OK ww cam get this done, then clear the room and get back to the city"**


[23/01/2024 6:24 PM] Dhan'ya (Aasimar Divine Soul Sorcerer)
Dhan'ya nods and smiles at Phan.  **"Of course.  Let's go Hemmer.  I agree about the spiders they certainly give me the creeps."**


[23/01/2024 6:25 PM] WMDM
Dhan'ya and Hemmer collect the volunteers, they don't seem to have any indication of changing their minds and follow the pair of adventurers cautiously but willingly.


[23/01/2024 6:27 PM] WMDM
Phan notices a distinct lack of spiders in the area.  As far as he can tell the webs that have been left on the fences are empty and if there are any spiders around, they're not visible.


[23/01/2024 6:28 PM] WMDM
The door to the 'safe' room seems to be locked securely and there would be no chance of a spider accidentally opening the door.


[23/01/2024 9:25 PM] WMDM
Re-entering the school room where The Book sits on the lectern, it calls out as the door opens.  **"Ahhh good.  You're back!  Oh ho!  And I see you've brought a few willing suckers along to help you out.  Ha ha!  It's true what they say.  Might is Right!  And you certainly are the mightiest around."**


[24/01/2024 1:23 AM] Phan
Phan enters behind everyone and looks to the group and the book. **"Sorry Book, but 'might' really doesn't have anything to do with what we are trying to do, though being right and helping those that need help is in the right. Especially if it helps more than those in front of us at the time."** Looking to the others. **"I guess I will start this show. Book, we have been informed that you seemingly can only answer one question per person a month. So I will start with a broadly pointed question and hope for the best answer. 'What or who is the source of control sending all of these spiders in such large amounts into populated areas?' If there is a who, that information would be the most helpful."** Phan cocks his head and smiles towards the book not knowing if its sentience can only hear or can see as well.


[24/01/2024 7:03 AM] WMDM
**"That's ok.  You're allowed to be wrong.  As for your two questions, I'll answer the what but not the who.  She's a humaniod, hmmmm, yes, human even.  5 foot 4 inches tall.  And she...  Ha ha!  She think's she a witch.  Oh well, I suppose she is in some respects."**


[25/01/2024 11:11 PM] Phan
Phan contemplates the answer from Book for a moment. **"You have my gratitude Mr. Book. Thank you kindly for your assistance in this quest of ours. As a side question that has nothing to do with anything we are working on, is there something you would be preferred to be called instead of just generally "Book"? If you are unable to answer that question because of answering a previous question due to whatever constraints you have, I understand. It would however be nice to show you respect by addressing you as you should properly be addressed."**


[28/01/2024 1:49 AM] WMDM
**"Well you're being awfully polite."** The book is quiet for a few seconds.  **"You're right though.  I feel like I may have had a name once, but I'm now just the book that answers questions."** The pages rustle gently and it sounds as if it may have been an attempt at a sigh, but the book remains quiet afterwards.


[28/01/2024 12:12 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Writing down the question "Where can this human female be found?"  And handing over to one of our colleagues


[28/01/2024 12:31 PM] WMDM
The local looks at the note then back at Hemmer and nods.  **"Excuse me book.  Where can this human female be found?"**
The book replies **"Oh I know that's not what you really want to know Paul.  You want to know if your brother is ok up north don't you.  Well, you're just going to have to wait to find out now!"** the book sounds jovial, but there is possibly a tinge of regret in it's voice.  **"The human female can be found in the town of Ipswich to the west.  A fair day's travel from here."**


[28/01/2024 2:59 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Looking at the others **" Book is Paul's brother ok?"**


[30/01/2024 4:01 AM] Phan
**"Wow, Book you really like to push people's buttons don't you? You couldn't just answer a question rather you had to insinuate that because someone was trying to help others instead of themselves that they must suffer for it.  Well, if that's how you must be, maybe it is better for you to be a book instead of a person as you do not show very good personable qualities."** Turning to Paul. **"I'm sorry if this has caused you and your brother pain and if I hear of anything I will gladly help you when this is done."**


[31/01/2024 6:37 AM] WMDM
**"There he is.  Got 'im.  Yeah he's doing fine thanks Hemmer thanks for asking.  Huh.  You really care don't cha Phan?  Actually Paul's brother asked a really juicy question when he visited that one time.  A real corker.  One to really ruffle the parchments you know.   But yeah.  Bit a storm up there recently, but his brother's doin' fine."**


[2/02/2024 4:02 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer shakes his head. **"Looks like we know what the next step is going to be. We will have to deal with this woman. One way or another she'll have to stop with the spiders"**


[2/02/2024 4:40 AM] Phan
Phan looks to the book, **"Yeah, I do care. People dying un-naturally is something for us to never be happy or lackluster about."** He then turns to the rest of the group,**"The question is.. if someone is free to ask... Is this person working with or for someone?  Also, are more spiders going to show up if and when a party is sent out to get to that town? Is there something about this person we should be extra worried/careful about? Maybe even if there is some item/tool we can use to help us deal with this quickly to keep all these people safe"**


[6/02/2024 9:04 PM] WMDM
Some of the others approach and ask Phan's questions.
**"Nah she's pretty much just working by herself.  Wait, is that cat hers or does she belong to the cat?  Those things always confuse me.  K k.  Next question.  Nope can't answer that one.  Nothing about the future.  Did I say that already?  I thought I said that already.  What's next then?  Yeah you SHOULD be worried!  She can control spiders!  Who wouldn't be worried about that?  Maybe a Mortein golem.  Wait do you lot have those or was that from the crash.  Hmmm.  Seems like history got a bit smashed together with the continents there as well.  As for keeping safe.  I recommend eating three square meals a day and getting plenty of fresh air and exercise.  Now I think you're down to one of your last questions, or are you going to let these fine people use their questions to help improve the place like they usually do.  They've got a lot of rebuilding to do and I really think they'd actually appreciate having their own questions as well."**


[10/02/2024 6:23 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
Steve looks around at the people that are there, then turning to the party **"do you think they will be OK here? or should we try and take them back to the coast and see if they want to settle there?"**


[10/02/2024 6:24 AM] fatallyinnocenttalemsteve
**"at least until they can rebuild this"**


[10/02/2024 6:34 AM] Phan
**"Well, assuming the spiders have for sure vacated, which Book could probably answer that for someone, I think they should be fine here.  They know what this place is and can do.  And we saved everyone from the safe building so they have a good start of people to rebuild."** Turning to the group that came with them to visit Book. **"Good people, it has been heart lifting to see those that survived and the strength you have. I trust that you will want to repair and rebuild this sanctuary.  However, should you choose to want to go back to Brisbandit you are welcome to travel with us in safety. I will put myself forth to protect any that desire to travel."**


[11/02/2024 10:22 PM] WMDM
Chuck nods at Phan and the others.  **"Yeah mate I think most of us are gonna stick around and rebuild the place.  It's our home now after all.""** One of the remaining residents steps over to the book.  **"Where's the nearest... Uh... Giant spider?"**

The book doesn't respond for a few seconds.  **"Well there's a particularly big one in a tree to the south, but that's only 3 inches across.  I think you're talking about the ones running back to Ipswich right now.  The closest is about 3,765 metres.  That's 2 point 3 3 9 4 6 3 miles for those who don't know the metric system."**


[13/02/2024 12:42 AM] Phan
Phan smiles. **"Thank you Book.  That was great information and the way it was delivered was precisely how I imagined you would have answered. You are truly a wonder.  And should you ever find need of assistance, I will make myself available to you in the future if you can find a way to reach out to me."** Phan then turns to the rest of the group. **"So, I feel completely rested and ready to head back. There is some work to do around here for sure, but it seems this crew has a good handle on things. Shall we head back to town and let Mr. Bandit know of what transpired here?"**


[15/02/2024 8:49 PM] WMDM
As the adventurers prepare to depart, they are met with heartfelt farewells and promises of friendship. The locals vow to rebuild and fortify their outpost, inspired by the courage and resilience of their newfound allies.

Chuck approaches the group, gratitude evident in his expression. "I can't thank you all enough," he begins, his voice tinged with emotion. "Without your bravery, we wouldn't have made it through."  Henry nods in agreement, seeming far more coherent than before. "You've not only saved us, but you've also given us hope," he adds, his words echoing the sentiment shared by all.

The survivors gather around, expressions of gratitude and admiration filling the air. They recount memories of the final battle and of the adventurers' heroism, their voices animated with awe and respect.

As the adventurers journey back to Brisbandit, the landscape unfolds before them in a serene panorama of rolling hills and verdant forests. The road stretches out ahead, winding its way through the countryside, bathed in the warm hues of the setting sun.

As they draw nearer to Brisbandit, the familiar sights and sounds of the town come into view. The town square bustles with activity, the sounds of laughter and conversation filling the air.
