The four adventurers are directed to a kangaroo farm that's been having some trouble situated to the west, just outside the town walls.  The journey does not take long and the directions are good.
The dusty dirt road leading up to Kaleb's kangaroo farm winds its way through the sprawling countryside of Brisbandit. The road is dotted with occasional potholes and is surrounded by tall grasses that sway in the wind. The landscape is rugged and wild, with few trees in sight. As you approach the farm, the road becomes increasingly bumpy. The ground is so dry and barren that clouds of dust swirl around your feet with each step. The heat of the sun beats down on your head, making you sweat and leaving you longing for the shade of the trees. Despite the journey, the view of the sprawling kangaroo farm in the distance, surrounded by rolling hills, makes the trip worthwhile.

**"This heat is uncomfortable, but it's invigorating to be on another adventure! My blade has been thirsting for some action."**


[31/01/2023 11:39 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt pulls out his cittern and starts playing an upbeat little tune to cheer everyone up through the heat. **"Here's my favorite jig. Hopefully we will be as successful here as we were on the last adventure!"** https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=IAMpJR4tPD0&feature=share

**"any of you know what a kangaroo is? Or how one farms it?  It is nice to get out of town and see things, this place is unlike anything I've heard of.  I think we need someone to draw some of the things we've seen and send them back to the Sword Coast, no one would believe they have a giant peanut statue"**


[1/02/2023 9:04 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Unfortunately, my artistic talents lie elsewhere."** He taps the hilt of his sword. **"But to answer your question, I am unfamiliar with any creature called a kangaroo. Though I believe I heard that black and white dog that maintains the dump refer to one of the creatures there by that name."**


[1/02/2023 9:31 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Can you describe this creature?  Are they dangerous?"**


[1/02/2023 9:40 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio attempts to spin a tale about a great beast that jumps like a rabbit but punches like a tavern brawler.


[1/02/2023 9:44 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**Jumps like a rabbit you say, and fights like a tavern brawler?  How large are these things?"** narrowing his eyes at Sergio. **"Are they infact related to the jackalope as well?"**


[1/02/2023 9:45 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio slaps him on the back and laughs heartily. **"I jest, my friend. It is true, I have heard the locals make mention of them, but I have not seen one with my own eyes. I guess we shall find out what the look like together"**


[1/02/2023 12:08 PM] WMDM
The farm is surrounded by vast plains and rolling hills, dotted with a few isolated eucalyptus trees that provide a bit of shade. The dusty dirt road leading up to the farm is well-worn, a testament to the daily comings and goings of farmers and workers. The farm itself is sprawling and rugged, dotted with fields of tough, sun-baked grasses that are home to Kaleb's kangaroo herd.

At the heart of the farm is the main homestead, a sprawling wooden building with a wraparound porch and a red tin roof. Adjacent to the homestead are several large barns and sheds, where the kangaroos are housed and tended to.

As the adventurers approach the farm, they see Kaleb standing outside his front porch, looking worried and frazzled. He greets them with a nod, his voice strained with worry.

Kaleb: **"G'day there, you lot look like you're from the city. What brings you out here to my farm?"**


[1/02/2023 12:19 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Hello there sir, we all just so happened to hear tale from Mr. McFlourish that you may have need of some help out here. He said he did a lot to help protect the inner city with the wall but it's still worried about his friends working outside the walls. He sent us here to see if we can help in any way. As a matter of fact, the four of us recently helped restore the big peanut."**


[1/02/2023 12:21 PM] jameshurburgh
Kaleb responds to the adventurers with a look of concern on his face, saying, **"It's a disaster, lads. All of my kangaroos have gone missing. They're the lifeblood of my farm and without them, I don't know how I'll keep going."**


[1/02/2023 12:23 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I assume kangaroo are some sort of live stock? Are we looking at like cows, goats or sheep?"** looking about to see if he sees any of the animals


[1/02/2023 12:32 PM] jameshurburgh
**"You've never seen a roo mate?  Well they're not really like cattle, but you can still farm 'em.  They're quite a sight to behold, I tell ya! Big, strong creatures they are, with their powerful hind legs and long, muscular tails. They're built for hopping, that's for sure! Their fur is soft and cuddly, and they have big, curious eyes. You can't miss 'em if you see 'em, I guarantee it!""**


[1/02/2023 12:42 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Anything else you can tell us about them? Are they friendly? How many do you think are out there? And if we do find these, what did you call it... a Roo? What's the best way to bring them back here?"**


[1/02/2023 12:50 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" what color are they generally? Antlers or horns? Are they aggressive?"**


[1/02/2023 5:43 PM] WMDM
**"They can be friendly yeah.  The ones we rear are fairly tame but they can pack a fair kick if they need to.  I've know wild ones to be pretty vicious when they're defending themselves too.  But yeah, nah.  Mine are all about six feet tall and light brown, horns or nothing.  Like I said, little arms, big legs and a big tail.  We had some reds a few years ago but we lost them all to a damn virus.  We had thirty six of them before the storm blew through a month ago and ruined the fences.  We managed to round them all up and I thought we'd put it right but the ground must have been soft or something because a week ago a section of came down and they all got out again.  As for rounding them up... Well usually we just chase them in the right direction, but sometimes we need to net them and rope 'em up if they're being difficult."**


[1/02/2023 8:37 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio is lost in his own thoughts and looks very confused. He's pretty sure he made up the story he told to Hemmer, but the descriptions from Kaleb sound too close to his own.


[1/02/2023 11:28 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt looks ponderously at the farmer. **"Do you have a painting of one of these creatures? If you are saying we may need rope, I have some in my pack that we can use.  Otherwise it's just a matter of getting on the other side of them and trying to herd them towards this farm? I think we can do that.  Are there any creatures that they may fear or are they predatory towards some creatures?"**


[2/02/2023 6:40 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Can you show us the place where the fence came down? It seems we should maybe investigate and repair that before trying to round them back up."**


[2/02/2023 7:00 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"We could use the break in the fence to herd them back through, we may not want to repair it until after "** Looking over at the rancher **"Is is still 36 we are looking for? Horses would be good for this work"**


[2/02/2023 7:35 AM] deamonlord
Hope picks himself up from where the heat had dropped him and looks around. "Checking out the fence would probably be a good idea, if it's always this hot I have a hard time believing the ground could ever be soft here. As for the creatures, they sound lovely and terrifying"


[2/02/2023 8:15 AM] WMDM
Kaleb whistles and another canine comes over.  **"Yeah boss?"**
Kaleb:  **"Hey Mike.  These folk are from the city and what to help out.  Go get the painting of a roo you've been workin' on mate, they've never even seen one of them."**
Mike: **"Uh yeah.  Sure thing boss."**
Mike runs up to the main house and comes back a minute later with a painting which he shows you, looking a little nervous as he does.

[2/02/2023 8:15 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"My word, it has TWO heads?"**


[2/02/2023 8:17 AM] WMDM
Kaleb: **"What?  Nah mate.  That's it joey in the pouch.  Crikey yous don't know anything about 'em do ya.  They're marsupials and they've got a pouch at the front.  That's where they carry their young, the joeys, before they can look after themselves."**


[2/02/2023 8:22 AM] WMDM
Kaleb **"So the fence is almost done with repairs.  That's what we've been workin' on.  We've got a gate so don't need to worry about getting them back in safely once they're here.  But yeah I'll show you how that works and where they got out ay?"** He starts walking you across the field to the other side of the paddock.  It's dry and dusty though off to the west the terrain rises up a little and the hills are covered in a hardy looking forest.


[2/02/2023 11:10 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Was someone near when they got out to see which direction they headed out of they just scattered?"** Tibalt decides to look around at the ground when they get to the escape point to see if he can see any tracks pointing to where they went, or if they went in multiple directions.


[2/02/2023 11:16 AM] WMDM
Kaleb: **"Storm came through overnight.  I out went to check on them in the middle of the night and they were scared but ok.  Then in the morning the fence was down and they were gone."** He says with a frown and wipes his forehead as you walk across the field.


[2/02/2023 11:24 AM] WMDM
As you get to the break in the fence you see two more canines working on reseating what looks like the last post in the fence.  The horizontal wooden slats still need adding, but it looks like there are only a few hours of work to be done before it's back to normal.
Sarah: **"Almost done Kaleb!"** one of the farm hands says cheerily.
Alex:  **"We've packed these one down.  Hard.  They won't be coming down any time soon."** says the other looking over their work with a critical eye.
The ground under and around the fence has no obvious kangaroo tracks as it's been thoroughly disturbed by the fence works.  There is a 12 foot wide double gate just next to where the repairs are being down which is currently open.  The ground is dry and the recent rain may have washed away tracks if you're unlucky.


[2/02/2023 11:15 PM] WMDM
Despite the rain washed dirt, Sergio is able to point out tracks of animals going in three different directions away from the fence.  One heading towards the distant hills, one across the plains and another towards and nearby gully.  However, Hope also notices something more.  Despite the fact that they have filled up with rain and dirt since, she's able to find a few two inch round impressions that must have had significant weight on them to make such a divot in the earth.


[3/02/2023 12:36 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt listens to Sergio and starts peering off towards the three directions wondering which direction may be the best to go first (Not hearing Hope's discovery yet). **"Well, you see tracks going 3 ways.  Not sure if there's a better way to head off. And I can't quite tell if there is more going on one way or another.  What do you guys think?"**


[3/02/2023 3:06 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Is there a water source nearby?  In this heat I'd imagine that they would head for that, or at least come back to it."** Listening to Tibalt.  **"what do these things eat?"**


[3/02/2023 6:35 AM] deamonlord
"hey y'all. Check out these divots with the tracks. Looks like something might have been chasing them."


[3/02/2023 6:37 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"That's odd what do you think would make a print like that? Does it look familiar to you Kaleb?"**


[3/02/2023 6:37 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Hmmm... Chasing them? Or herding them?"**


[3/02/2023 6:39 AM] jvanblaricom0001
kneeling down next to the tracks. **"nothing I'm familiar with, but that seems to be a common theme around here"**


[3/02/2023 6:40 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Kaleb, is there anything that might go after the kangaroos and their... Josephs are they called? Or any competitors to your operation? We can exclude the possibility."**


[3/02/2023 8:28 AM] WMDM
Kaleb looks down at the new tracks that Hope points out with interest.  **"Well that's new."** he says with a worried frown.  **"This might not just be an escape after all.  Maybe someone, or some*thing* is poaching them."** his frown gets deeper, clearly worried for his animals.  **"So there's a bit of a creek come off the hills, comes down and fills our dam sometimes but mostly just runs off into the gully over there and back into the main Brisbandit River.  Roos are herbivores though not predators.  They'll just eat grass, shrubs, fruit, flowers, whatever they can get.  I try to keep a mix of stuff growing here in their fields where I can so keep the nutrients in the soil.  Oh and they're called Joeys, not Josephs.  Fair Dinkum you lot crack me up."**


[3/02/2023 8:38 AM] deamonlord
"should we split up? One group check the creek, and one check out the gully? If something is hunting them it would be sad to see them hurt "


[3/02/2023 9:00 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"What would hunt them? Are we looking at a Drop bear? or is it someone poaching?"**


[3/02/2023 9:06 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"well, if there was something chasing after them and those round tracks go off in a singular direction, vi would say that's the direction to go first. And I'm not sure splitting up will be the best idea."**


[3/02/2023 9:08 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I tend to agree with Tibalt on this one. We have seen some of the monstrosities this place has thrown at us. Could it be spiders like at the Peanut?"**


[3/02/2023 9:10 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Spiders do have rounded feet, but these would be bigger, I think, than any we saw already if it is."**


[3/02/2023 9:38 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"I would agree that splitting up is not wise. If there is a threat, it is most likely in the direction of these other tracks. I say we investigate those. If the kangaroos have gone off to the other locations, they can likely fend for themselves for the time being."**


[3/02/2023 10:55 PM] deamonlord
"Fair points, we did good sticking together last time. I'm all in for following the strange tracks. onward?"


[3/02/2023 10:58 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"Please lead, Hope, as you seem our best tracker."**


[3/02/2023 11:36 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"OK, sounds like we are agreed on sticking together. Is there anything else we may need to worry about or look out for that you know of Kaleb? The most successful adventures are the ones with the least surprises. At least in all the stories I tell. Though to be honest, they can also be the most boring to tell."** Tibalt chuckles at that last thought remembering a few taverns he was in and listening to stories and falling asleep during a few.


[4/02/2023 12:32 AM] WMDM
**"Well the roos can be skittish.  'Specially if they don't know you, but if you can steer them in the right direction they'll be back in no time.  Oh yeah.  They're pretty fast blighters as well."** Kaleb says.  **"Thanks again for your help ay."**


[4/02/2023 4:34 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Well, skittish we can handle I think with the 4 of us. We will do our best Kaleb to get them back for you."** Looking to everyone else, **"Alright, shall we follow them in the direction the round prints are headed first then?  I say let's get going."**


[4/02/2023 6:57 AM] deamonlord
Hope dusts himself off and takes a sip from his water thingy and starts walking off, following the strange tracks. "onward to adventure!"


[5/02/2023 11:09 AM] WMDM
Though faint and partially washed away, with some help Hemmer is able follow the round imprinted tracks towards the hills.  Tibalt finds an especially deep one and notices quiet a few similarities between it and spider tracks.


[5/02/2023 11:12 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Yeah, looking at this area here... I think we may be dealing with bigger spiders than we just dealt with.  They have that round leg look that seems like it is a natural step.  And if we look at the placement, I would say we should be ready for more webbing."** Tibalt shivers at the thought of possibly larger spiders than they dealt with before helping with the big peanut.


[5/02/2023 11:58 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio pats Tibault on the back. **"Fear not, friend Tibault. Though I am no fan of spiders, we dealt with the last batch easily enough. Bigger, yes. But we are also more experienced. It will be a good challenge!"**


[5/02/2023 12:05 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I reckon bigger just means more to burn"**


[5/02/2023 3:00 PM] WMDM
As you leave Kaleb's farm and travel deeper into the Australian bush, the scenery around you begins to change. The dry, dusty land gives way to a more lush and verdant landscape, with tall trees casting cooling shade and dense underbrush adding to the feeling of abundance. The air becomes more humid, and the sounds of nature fill your ears - the chirping of insects, the rustling of leaves, and the occasional call of a bird.

As you journey further, you start to see signs of the kangaroos that were lost from Kaleb's farm. Tracks and droppings dotted along the path suggest that they have passed this way, and you can't help but feel that you're getting closer to your goal. The landscape begins to change, becoming more overgrown and wild.

The trees grew taller and closer together, forming a dense canopy overhead. The ground is soft underfoot, cushioned by a thick layer of fallen leaves and twigs. As the party continue on their journey, they began to pick up on subtle signs of danger. The occasional broken tree and web-covered bush hinted at the presence of something sinister lurking in the shadows.

As they push on, they spot more and more webs woven between the trees. The webs were huge, easily the size of a house, and glistened in the dappled light filtering through the branches. They could hear faint rustling and the occasional snap of twigs, which suggested that whatever had spun the webs was still nearby.

They soon came across a clearing where they could see several of the marsupials, trapped in the center of a massive spider's web. The spiders themselves were nowhere to be seen, but their presence was unmistakable.


[5/02/2023 3:04 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt looks to the others and quietly says, **"Fire on the webs will be less than ideal this time around I think... at least if we want to save these things properly.  Look around and see if you can see where the spiders are. Probably best to stick closer to gether."**


[5/02/2023 3:10 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"the trees make a lot more dangerous this time. "** looking around to see where the sounds are coming from


[5/02/2023 11:17 PM] WMDM
The party can all see the kangaroos tangled up in the web, a few thick tails protruding from webby cocoons.  It looks like at least a few of them are still alive.  Tibalt notices four large sacks of webbing hanging from the trees between the party and the kangaroos, however Hemmer points out perhaps the most worrying thing.  A pair of giant spiders in the trees around 90 feet above them sitting motionless, but perhaps watching them.  The spiders were large, with legs as thick as branches and bulbous bodies the size of a small cart.


[6/02/2023 12:26 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Well this certainly won't be as easy as before. But as I said before..."** He smirks... **"A worthwhile challenge."** He draws his blade and readies his shield in case the spiders attack quickly.


[6/02/2023 1:56 AM] deamonlord
Hope lays a hand onto Sergio's shoulder as his other grabs his amulet of Selune, offering a prayer to the goddess and filling him with a bit of luck


[6/02/2023 2:42 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Pointing to the spiders, **"Well... Those are definitely bigger. I wonder if they are waiting for us to hit the web... Smart idea of they are. I can however get a touch closer and start this battle when we are ready. What say you fellows?"**


[6/02/2023 2:53 AM] jvanblaricom0001
nodding as he shifts his mace and shield infront of him. **"Not much else we can do but get in there."**


[6/02/2023 2:56 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Strumming his cittern he begins to lift off the ground as he casts fly on himself. **"Well, just say the word and I will get a little closer and start this show."**


[6/02/2023 3:02 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Bring them to us. Not all of us can fly."**


[6/02/2023 3:18 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"That's the plan. Lure them down here and fight on our terms"**


[6/02/2023 9:15 AM] jameshurburgh
As Tibalt takes to the air, one of the spider's legs shift slightly above you.


[6/02/2023 9:53 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Nodding towards the spider. **" They are definitely not sleeping or unaware of us. Everyone ready yourselves. "** Tibalt tests out their reaction and moves 5 feet higher in the air. (About 10 feet total)


[6/02/2023 9:58 AM] deamonlord
Hope grips his mace tightly as he readies to cast fae fire as soon as the spiders descend


[6/02/2023 10:11 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer sets his shield and waits to cast Bane as soon as they are close enough to catch the pair in the spell


[6/02/2023 11:37 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt seeing that they aren't coming down yet raises 5 more feet bringing him to about 15 feet and looks to the group. **"OK, should I just step up and start it now? I'm not seeing any others in the area so if we can get these two down, we should be able to help those poor Kangathingies. They have to be extra stressed right now."**


[6/02/2023 11:40 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio grips his shield tighter. **"Bring them down!"**


[7/02/2023 8:01 AM] deamonlord
"We're ready ribs!"


[7/02/2023 10:46 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt flies up about 15 feet striking a few high pitch chords on his cittern causing damage to the closer spider then moves back to where he was. (Will cast shatter officially when map is up.)


[8/02/2023 1:25 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Looking to Sergio, ***I'm looking forward to telling stories of the boisterous blade! Show me what you can do when they get closer!!"**


[8/02/2023 9:23 PM] WMDM
As Tibalt taunts them and casts the spell one of the spiders quickly descends and shoots sticky webs at the flying bard.


[8/02/2023 9:41 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt tries to make the spider that webbed him flee away a bit with some vocal distance but was unsuccessful.


[8/02/2023 9:41 PM] WMDM
The second spider seems to ignore the sticky Tibalt and descends until it's level with him sround 30 feet from the ground eyeing off the other adventurers and chittering as it moves.


[8/02/2023 9:42 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
looking to Hope. **"Your heals are very important, please remember that next time someone needs healing that you are an integral part of our team!"**


[8/02/2023 11:13 PM] l33tb4c0n
Unable to reach the spiders yet, Sergio tries to distract the one closest to Tibalt with a crossbow bolt. However, he's out of practice, and the bolt misses wildly.


[10/02/2023 2:38 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer mutters out an incantation and streak of energy erupts from his shield solidly hitting the spider leaving it surrounded by a shimmering light.


[10/02/2023 7:29 AM] WMDM
Two of the hanging sacks of web wriggles as though something is inside.


[10/02/2023 8:33 AM] deamonlord
Seeing his friend Tibalt being webbed up, hope calls upon the bells of the underworld, ringing loudly and vibrating the spider, causing it sever pain "Ha take that you overgrown flea!"


[10/02/2023 8:38 AM] WMDM
One of the web sacks wriggles and bursts into swarm of tiny spiders.


[10/02/2023 8:39 AM] WMDM
Tge first spider descends another 30 ft then shoots more sticky webs at Hemmer, but misses.


[10/02/2023 9:03 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs floats down the rest of the way and with a little difficulty removes the webbing freeing his arms again.


[10/02/2023 10:30 AM] WMDM
The second spider stays 30ft up and shoots a web at Sergio, narrowly missing the fighter.


[10/02/2023 10:59 AM] l33tb4c0n
After his last shot missed, Sergio pauses a moment. He takes a deep breathe and centers himself amidst the battle. Steadying his crossbow, he aims for the first spider and lines it up dead in his sight. He calmly exhales and pulls the trigger. The bolt flies swift and true, striking the spider directly in the head. It drops immediately - a smooth kill.


[10/02/2023 4:41 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer rushes a shot with his crossbow watching it fly wide


[10/02/2023 8:34 PM] deamonlord
Seeing the second spider Hope calls down sacred moon fire onto it, but let's out a cough in the middle of casting, missing his target


[11/02/2023 10:33 AM] WMDM
The swarm of spiders skitters slowly to Sergio, standing stalwartly.
Northward, noticeable noise notifies of no need to nap now.


[11/02/2023 10:39 AM] WMDM
The first spiders body comes crashing to the ground a mess of legs and sticky webs.  The second spider descends to the ground and chitters at the party.


[11/02/2023 10:41 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt tries to make the second spider run but it started stalwart. Then looking to Hemmer, **"Remember the forge. These types of spiders can show up in town let's not let that happen!"**


[11/02/2023 11:08 AM] WMDM
The second web sack wriggles but stays intact.  At the same time the noises from the north move further south and the third giant spider is now visible in the trees 30 feet up.


[11/02/2023 12:40 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer rushes forward to stand at Sergio's side, swinging his mace in an massive overhand swing, missing the swarm

Seeing the injured spiders, Hope calls upon the bells of doom again, but the chittering leaves it less effective then, Hoped, for


[11/02/2023 4:26 PM] WMDM
A swarm of spiders start crawling all over Hemmer, but none of them manage to bite him.


[11/02/2023 7:06 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Seeing the swarm covering Hemmer, tibs chants a dissonant s whisper causing a bit of pain making them temporarily flee.


[11/02/2023 7:10 PM] WMDM
The second giant spider skitters around the swarms of its brood half up the cliff side and then sinks its fangs in Hope's shoulder.


[11/02/2023 9:57 PM] l33tb4c0n
Seeing Hope drop, Sergio turns on the spider that bit him. His adrenaline surges, and he calls upon all his skill. He stabs twice in rapid succession, driving his rapier deep into the spider for a killing blow.

The last of the web sacks bursts in another swarm of spiders.


[11/02/2023 10:05 PM] WMDM
The last giant spider scuttles forward and bites at Tibalt's boots.


[12/02/2023 1:22 PM] jvanblaricom0001
As the swarm starts to cover him, Hemmer swings wildly at the giant spider missing his mark. Then he mutters out a quick spell sending healing to Hope


[12/02/2023 1:23 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"These seem to be harder to hit than the last set"**


[12/02/2023 3:38 PM] WMDM
Hope awakens, crumpled on the ground and finds it's all she can do to open her eyes.  The site of the bite is completely numb and it feels like the rest of her body is barely there.  She tries to move her lips but they too, feel numb, and she can't even form words.


[12/02/2023 3:44 PM] WMDM
The swarms of spiders scurry back to cover Sergio and Hemmer, but are unable to get under their armour.


[12/02/2023 4:03 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt quickly stabs out with his rapier dealing a bit of damage to the new giant spider that just showed up.


[12/02/2023 7:58 PM] l33tb4c0n
The adrenaline of Hope's near death passing, Sergio's attention is pulled to the swarm quickly trying to crawl up his legs. He fumbles with his sword. While he lands two blows, neither is particularly effective.


[12/02/2023 8:05 PM] WMDM
The last giant spider remaining sinks his fangs into Tibalts arm injecting it's deadly poison.  Tibalt instantly feels the affects as the toxins rush through his veins.


[13/02/2023 12:00 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer hunkers down behind his shield calling for a spell to make it harder for the spiders to hit them


[13/02/2023 12:01 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"best I can do"**


[13/02/2023 8:43 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio continues to fumble with the swarm covering him, landing only one minor blow.


[13/02/2023 10:52 PM] WMDM
Another swarm of tiny spiders covers the ground around Tibalt's feet and the Giant Spider covers him in sticky webs.


[13/02/2023 11:49 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer brings his mace to bear landing a solid blow to the giant spider


[14/02/2023 12:53 AM] WMDM
The last swarm of spiders crawls up and onto Hope's paralyzed body, the others around Sergio swarm up his legs, but are unable to attack him.


[14/02/2023 6:01 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt after getting hurt by the big spider pulls out his cittern quick and plays a quick few notes charging a healing music through his body.


[14/02/2023 7:31 AM] deamonlord
Hope tries to mumble through the paralysis "Frelling spiders."


[14/02/2023 9:20 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs shivers and shakes in the webbing and spider swarm then shouts... **"Sorry about this ahead of time!"** And casts thunderwave dropping some of the spiders and pushing the swarm on him 10 feet away.


[14/02/2023 9:47 AM] WMDM
The force of the impact sends spiders flying in all directions, and many of them are instantly killed by the sheer power of the spell. The ground trembles beneath their writhing bodies, and many of those that remain are stunned, writhing in pain or dazed from the shock. The ground is littered with the bodies of fallen spiders.


[14/02/2023 10:09 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio is sent flying. He lands, shaking his head, as the adrenaline of battle gives him a second wind. He uses the momentary break from the fray to spot an opportunity, rushing forward to the paralyzed form of Hope. He stabs with expert precision at the swarming spiders threatening to engulf his comrade.


[14/02/2023 10:13 AM] WMDM
One of the swarms blasted away from Tibalt seems to want to live to see another day and begins scurrying off into the forest.

[14/02/2023 9:14 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Seeing the spider swarm escaping, Tibs casts one last spell dropping them before they get away.


[14/02/2023 11:17 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer flops to the ground not knowing how else to attack the swarm on him. trying to roll to crush them.


[14/02/2023 11:38 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio moves next to the prone Hemmer and begins trying to carefully kick the spiders off without hitting Hemmer in the process.


[14/02/2023 11:43 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs attempts to swing his sword at the swarm on Hemmer and trips causing the point to go into hemmer's shoulder. looking down he quickly sheaths his rapier and says, **"So sorry Hemmer!  I promise I'll make it up to you."**


[14/02/2023 11:57 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer continues to flail about trying to crush the swarming spiders. **"this is nightmare fuel"**


[15/02/2023 12:21 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Failing to break free of the sticky webs, he looks to Sergio **"Your panache has been proven over and over. You are definitely an exemplar fighter.  Help us finish this off!"**


[15/02/2023 12:44 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio makes an inspired stomp on the swarming spiders. But despite a well placed boot, some still seem to be wiggling.


[15/02/2023 12:46 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Fear not Hemmer! This will be over soon!"** He shouts, as he continues trying to stomp.


[15/02/2023 12:49 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer continues to roll crushing some of the swarm but not all of them


[15/02/2023 10:53 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt still struggling fails yet again to extricate himself from the gummy webbing.


[15/02/2023 11:07 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio finally drives his rapier through the remaining swarmling, killing it and pinning it to the ground next to Hemmer.


[15/02/2023 11:08 AM] l33tb4c0n
He takes a deep breath and exhales slowly, then extends a hand to Hemmer to help him up.


[15/02/2023 12:23 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Standing up with Sergio's help. **"Im starting to get a healthy fear of these things. "**


[15/02/2023 12:55 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs frees himself and looks to Hope and rushes over to him funding in his pouch for a potion. **"You ok Hope?"**


[15/02/2023 12:57 PM] deamonlord
Hope let's out a cough, looking up. "I came to grow stronger, so my village could be remembered. I'm sorry." With the last word, his breath fails and his body falls limp, the light leaving his eyes cold and glassy.

[15/02/2023 1:01 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs shakes Hope and checks again for a pulse. **"Come on Hope... We got the spiders! Wake up!!!"** Realizing there is no waking, Tibalt closes Hope's eyes. **"I shall sing a ballad for you when this is over friend. You fought well and did your village proud. Rest now, we will carry the fight on for you."**


[15/02/2023 1:04 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Standing up and looking at the others, **"We lost a good friend today. Let's see if we can salvage this and at least save some of these Roo things."**  Tibalt begins searching the wedding for any signs of living kangaroos.


[15/02/2023 1:30 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer kneels next to Hope.   **"Im sorry Hope.  You're name will live on In our hearts"** laying Hopes shield on his chest.


[15/02/2023 1:30 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio stands in shock looking down at Hope. He looks at his sword, then back to Hope with a mix of disbelief and confusion.


[15/02/2023 1:31 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"we should see if there are any living creatures "**


[15/02/2023 1:32 PM] l33tb4c0n

**"this is my fault, and I will have to atone for it"**


[15/02/2023 1:48 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Pausing a moment on his search for a living roo, he looks to Hemmer. **"This fault lies on the spiders. It is a risk we take as adventurers. How one that. If I go, I would hope to go as he did... Fighting for a good cause. He will be missed for sure. If you feel you need to atone, pray to your God for guidance and continue fighting in Hope's stead."**


[15/02/2023 1:56 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding **" I should have been better. I should have been stronger in my faith to heal him"** checking over the body slowly setting aside items that the living could use


[15/02/2023 2:09 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Laying his holy symbol on his chest. Hemmer gathers up the rest of his things in Hope's kit bag. **"We might need this before we see the end of this"**


[15/02/2023 6:54 PM] WMDM
The forest, now a scene of both victory and loss, was silent after the battle with only the occasional rustle of leaves breaking the stillness. The spiders had been defeated, but the cost had been high.  It was a cruel twist of fate that Hope, their brave companion, had fallen in battle. They had fought together for so long, and now he was gone.


[15/02/2023 6:55 PM] WMDM
As the party looked into the clearing, they saw the horror that the spiders had wrought. Giant webs were strung up everywhere, and within them were kangaroos trapped and struggling to break free.

Some of the kangaroos were motionless, lifeless and dangling from the webs like macabre ornaments. Others were still alive, writhing and struggling to escape the sticky grip of the webs. It was hard to tell which kangaroos were still alive and which had already perished in the spiders' grasp.

The sight was heart-wrenching, and it was clear that the kangaroos had been suffering for some time. Their fur was matted and caked with webbing, their eyes wide with terror and exhaustion.


[15/02/2023 11:12 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer uses Hopes dagger to start cutting the roos free from the webbing.  Starting with the ones with the most fight left in them first


[15/02/2023 11:28 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio is still dumbfounded, standing over Hope's body. **"Surely we cannot simply leave our friend here..."**


[15/02/2023 11:36 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt looks to Sergio, **"I agree, but first we must see to the health of the Kangaroos and save what we can save."** Tibalt then turns to the kangaroos and starts to find any more that he can free wondering if there's any easy way to keep them calm hoping that when they are free they will remember where they came from and start heading there post haste.


[15/02/2023 11:47 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" we will take him back to town once we get these roos back.  If no one objects I will turn his armor into a marker."** continuing to work on the webbing


[16/02/2023 12:33 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"I would like that very much. If you need a place to display it, I can enshrine it at the new branch of Panache Co. A memorial to a fallen brother in arms."**


[16/02/2023 12:34 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio shakes himself out of his dourness, at least enough to begin helping to free the kangaroos.


[16/02/2023 12:37 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I would think we should hang his shield there, I think he is the first of us to give his life in this land. "**


[16/02/2023 12:38 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"That's a great idea. Once the last of these are free, I can hold it if you want to hammer it in place"**


[16/02/2023 12:39 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"No no, we mean to hang it back in town. Though you are welcome to carry it."**


[16/02/2023 12:41 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Sorry, mind isn't working well with all of this. That does make more sense. I shall gladly and with honor carry Hope's shield with us until we get back to town."**


[16/02/2023 12:43 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" maybe we can bury him at the ranch, and I can place the marker there.  Then we take his shield back with us.  I don't know the customs of the locals"**

Hemmer tries to calm the roos as he cuts through the webbing


[16/02/2023 11:21 PM] WMDM
With nimble fingers and sharp blades, the party works together to cut the kangaroos free from the webs.  Some of the kangaroos are still alive, their eyes wide with fear and exhaustion. Hemmer kneels beside them, murmuring words of comfort and the kangaroos begin to calm, taking comfort in the gentle touch of the cleric.  Slowly but surely, they free all of the kangaroos from the webs.  All but one.  The last kangaroo has a wild look in it's eye and it's difficult enough to get near it without being kicked let alone cut it free.


[16/02/2023 11:53 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt sees the flailing roo and pulls his cittern out and begins to slowly walk towards it playing a soothing melody watching to see if it helps. https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=6dGlLwdbgU0&feature=share

[17/02/2023 12:59 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer slowly moves toward the last of the webbed roos, murmuring in a calm voice, hoping that mixed with the calming song it will work and he won't take one of these massive feet to the chest.  Working the blade against the webbing


[17/02/2023 7:01 AM] WMDM
As he cuts through the final strands, the kangaroo suddenly springs up, its powerful hind legs kicking out at Hemmer with all its might. Hemmer barely has time to brace himself before he feels the full force of the creature's blow, knocking him off his feet.

Surprised and slightly winded, Hemmer watches as the kangaroo quickly rolls to its feet and bounds off into the surrounding forest.


[17/02/2023 7:03 AM] WMDM
All in all you've got five kangaroos able to walk and trembling, three that are alive but lying down, seemingly unable to move themselves, the one that got away and sadly a few who are no longer alive.


[17/02/2023 8:02 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Walking to each of the roos and offering them a berry, hoping it will get them up and moving back toward the ranch


[17/02/2023 10:52 AM] WMDM
The roos happily gobble up the offered berries and instantly perk up, but instead of hopping off like the other one, hang around waiting for more.  You feel like you could probably lead them home in this state.


[17/02/2023 12:22 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt begins helping search around for ticket streams of webbing that can be used to lash some small trees together to help with the creation of the stretcher


[17/02/2023 12:27 PM] l33tb4c0n
When he sees Tibalt's actions, Sergio solemnly begins collecting branches that can be lashed together. It doesn't take long to collect enough to fashion a stretcher that can be dragged behind him. He wordlessly moves Hope's body into place, positioning it in a peaceful and respectful manner. He hefts the handles so he can begin the walk back.


[17/02/2023 12:29 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"I should be able to carry him most of the way, though I may need a break or two. If the two of you can tend to the kangaroos, we can begin our way back."**


[17/02/2023 12:30 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio falls silent, a marked change from his usual boisterous nature.


[17/02/2023 12:32 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"If you need it lightened, I can levitate it for an hour taking the strain off you. It's the best I can do right now."** Tibalt nods to Sergio and Hemmer while going to flank the roos opposite Hemmer.


[17/02/2023 12:43 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I will take a turn when you need a break"** shouldering Hopes gear, and trying to guide the roos back toward the ranch


[17/02/2023 6:44 PM] WMDM
The journey back to the farm is uneventful.  Occasionally, a kangaroo will pause to nibble on some nearby grass, but with the offer of a berry, they are soon on their way again. The group moves steadily forward, each step bringing them closer to their destination.  They pull the sled with great care, moving slowly and steadily and eventually as the sun is threatening to set the farm comes back into sight.

As they reach the farm, Kaleb is already at the gate, anxiously waiting for his beloved kangaroos. His eyes light up as he sees the group approach, and his smile widens as he takes in the sight of the recovered animals.

**"Thank you, thank you so much for finding this mob."** he exclaims, clapping his paws with glee.

The group enters the farm, and the kangaroos begin to scatter, hopping and bounding around the open space. Kaleb eagerly ushers them into the enclosure, to the sound of the gate clanging shut. But as he turns back to the group, he notices the sled and the still form of Hope.

His face falls, and his joy is replaced with surprise and disbelief.  **"Oh, no,"** he says **"Bloody hell.  What happened out there?"**


[17/02/2023 10:20 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt steps up knowing this is his time to shine and begins weaving the story about the battle that just occurred. Telling about the different spiders and all the webbing. Telling how Hope heroically sacrificed himself saving the kangaroos. Telling how Sergio and Hemmer both showed amazing feats of attack and intelligence. And of course his own parts with casting the occasional useful spell too. Ending with the rescue of most of the roos and the trip back.


[18/02/2023 9:47 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"There may still be kangaroos for us to help recover, but we have taken a heavy toll today. I think we need an opportunity to rest and recover before we go searching for any more."**


[18/02/2023 11:16 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" There was one that ran away.  Do you mark them in some way?"**


[19/02/2023 12:08 PM] WMDM
Kaleb's face fell as Tibalt recounted the story of the rescue and Hope's demise. **"Bloody hell,"** he muttered, shaking his head. **"That's a real shocker, mate. Poor Hope. And you lot, you're real legends for savin' the rest of the mob. Good on ya."**

He paused for a moment, taking in the gravity of the situation. **"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help with a ceremony or something for Hope.  But for you lot, a proper Aussie thank you. We've got some beer, and some meat pies in the oven."** He says with a respectful nod.  **"But first, let's get these roos settled in and fed. They'll be hungry after all that time stuck in the webs."**


[19/02/2023 12:11 PM] WMDM
As Hemmer watches the roos begin to settle back into their field his eyes lock onto a wild-eyed kangaroo, darting up and down the far end of the field.  Sure enough it was the one that got away.  Kaleb gives a laugh as he notices where Hemmer is looking.  **"Oh yeah.  Skitz.  He made it back maybe a half hour ago.  He's always been a bit on the jumpy side but I reckon he decided he'd rather be penned up here than out there with the spiders."**


[19/02/2023 12:12 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio smirks a bit... some happy news amidst the tragedies.


[19/02/2023 12:13 PM] WMDM
Two farmhands begin to take care of the kangaroos. They approach the animals slowly, speaking softly to them and offering them food and water. The roos are still a little jumpy, but they seem to calm down a little in the presence of the caring farmhands. They work tirelessly to make sure each of the kangaroos is tended to, checking them over for any injuries and making sure they have plenty of space to move around. Slowly but surely, the kangaroos begin to settle back in.


[19/02/2023 12:22 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"good to know, I wasn't sure if it was going to make it back"** turning and looking at the others.  Hemmer walks to Hope's corpse and works the armor off as gently and respectfully as possible.  Once its off he lays it out infront of him and begins to pray


[19/02/2023 12:33 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio stands nearby solemnly. **"I admit, I have never been much for religion. But it seems, as Hope had his beliefs, that we should probably honor him in whatever fashion his religion demands. If any of you are familiar with that, I defer to you. Otherwise, Hemmer seems like the next best one to lead here."**


[19/02/2023 12:41 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding in acknowledgment of Sergio's statement.  Hemmer continues to pray over the armor


[19/02/2023 12:41 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs watches Hemmer in silence and awe taking mental note of everything. Looking to Sergio he quietly says, **"I'm not much of a religion specific man though I do have my beliefs. I agree that we may want to defer to Hemmer as well"**


[19/02/2023 12:43 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Looking up at the two of them, **" this will take about an hour, then we can move forward"**


[19/02/2023 12:45 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Looking back to Kaleb, **"That beer and meat pies sounds fun and delicious. I would greatly appreciate some. Is there a place for us to go, or sitting down and resting here the plan?"**


[19/02/2023 12:50 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer goes back to praying over the chain mail


[19/02/2023 12:52 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"I agree with Tibalt. We should eat and rest. Hope would want us to take care of ourselves. Hemmer, when you have finished your work, please join us."**


[19/02/2023 1:11 PM] jvanblaricom0001
After an hour the armor changes until a likeness of Hope's profile in a sheet of steel is what appears in its place.  Carrying it to the others.  **"this is how we honor him"** offering it to Sergio before reaching for a beer


[19/02/2023 1:11 PM] WMDM
Kaleb leads you to the farmhouse.  The dining room is a big space, with a long table made of rich, sturdy wood that could seat a whole family of workers. The walls are painted in a warm, earthy colour, and there's a big fireplace on one end that would be perfect for roasting some farm-fresh veggies or a nice piece of meat. The room is decorated with all sorts of farm-themed items, like pictures of cattle and horses, farming tools hung up on the walls, and jars of homemade preserves lining the shelves. You can smell the sweet fragrance of fresh-baked pies coming from the kitchen, and there's a sense of warmth and cosiness that makes you feel right at home.

Kaleb's missus bustles around the kitchen, filling plates with hearty servings of meat pies and wiping her hands on her apron. The smell of savoury pies wafts through the air, causing stomachs to rumble in anticipation. She grabs a few jugs of beers from the cool-room and sets them on the table, the condensation dripping down the bottles. With a smile, she calls out to Kaleb and the farmhands to come and get it while the pies are still hot.


[19/02/2023 1:18 PM] WMDM
During dinner Kaleb's wife, Sharon, mentions that you're welcome to sleep inside by the fire and bustles about setting up blankets to make sure the party is comfortable.


[19/02/2023 1:28 PM] jvanblaricom0001

Grabbing a beer and meat pie, tibs sits down and raises his glass. **"Is like to propose a toast to Hope. Though he was only in our lives for a short while, he was definitely a valuable member of the team. He will be missed. Though things seem bleak to us, we accomplished a lot already and can not give up. How would be proud to know that we rescued most of these roos. We are not done here. He would want us to see this through.*"" He then pauses to allow others to say something.


[20/02/2023 8:30 AM] jvanblaricom0001
nodding along with Tibalts words. **" Hope came to make a name for himself and his village. With his sacrifice let neither of them be forgotten"**


[20/02/2023 8:51 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio raises his glass. **"The true mark of any warrior is a willingness to lay down their lives for a noble cause. Hope wanted to help however he could - to be a force of food in this new world. And he did not hesitate to step into danger, even though it cost him. He will be remembered for his efforts to help this new land."**


[20/02/2023 9:01 AM] WMDM
Sharon clears up after you, making sure you have everything you need and that you're comfortable and settled for the night.  Eventually the lights are snuffed out and the sounds of the night are the only things that fill the air.


[20/02/2023 9:11 AM] WMDM
Hemmer tosses and turns in his sleep, tormented by the guilt of accidentally striking Hope during the battle.

In his dreams, he finds himself in a sea of flames. Blinking away the ash and soot, he stands before a grand forge that radiates heat so intense that the air shimmers in a haze, and the ground beneath his feet feels like molten metal. The roar of the fire drowns out all other sound, except for the steady, rhythmic pounding of the smith's hammer.

The imposing figure of the smith, his face hidden behind a mask of red-hot metal, moves with a grace that belies his enormous strength. Hemmer can barely make out the intricate details of the forge, so intense is the heat, but he can sense that he is in the presence of a master.

In the midst of the roar of the forge, Hemmer's eyes widen as he recognizes that the figure before him is not just a mere blacksmith, but Gond himself. The deity's eyes gleam with an inner fire as he works the molten metal, shaping it into Hemmer's likeness with a precision that borders on the miraculous.

As the sparks fly and the flames dance around them, Hemmer sees the image of himself slowly take shape. Every detail is perfect, from the texture of his skin to the lay of his hair. It is as if Gond is not only crafting Hemmer's body, but also his very soul.


[20/02/2023 9:12 AM] WMDM
Gond's voice rumbles in Hemmer's mind, a deep and powerful sound that seems to resonate throughout his being. **"Selune is no enemy and works in many of the same ways as I,"** he says. **"But I know that she understands the nature of mortals and the mistakes you make. Mistakes are made in battle, but they must not be repeated. You are my servant, and I desire that you learn from this. Honor Hope's memory, Hemmer, and go forth with renewed purpose. This is not punishment, but merely a reminder."**

As Hemmer looks up at Gond, he sees the deity's powerful hands pick up a symbol that he recognizes immediately. It is the symbol of Selune, identical to the one he retrieved from Hope's body. Gond takes the symbol and places it on the likeness of Hemmer that he is forging, bringing his mighty hammer down with a thunderous strike.

As the hammer falls, Hemmer feels a searing pain shoot through his thigh. Looking down, he sees that the pendant with the symbol of Selune is now branded into his flesh.

Hemmer jolts awake, drenched in sweat, as if pulled back into reality from a deep dream. The pain in his thigh is excruciating, and he sees the symbol of Selune red hot and glowing brightly in the darkness. The skin where it was branded is raw and tender, yet Hemmer feels a sense of power emanating from the wound, a warmth that spreads through his body. The symbol falls off his flesh and is instantly cool to the touch, yet the image of Selune remains.

The following morning, Sergio is up at the crack of dawn, practicing fencing moves in the yard. He is not making much sound, as he does not want to wake the others. An air of grim determination surrounds him - a sense that he must push himself to be better than he already is.


[21/02/2023 12:29 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs wakes and stretches. Noticing Sergio out practicing he silently joins him, pulling out his rapier and following along in the forms. Wordlessly sharing there moment of understanding. Seeing each other grow in strength, the is definitely a bond growing between Sergio, Hemmer, and Tibalt. After a bit of time building up a sweat practicing, tibs nods to Sergio then sits in a corner for a bit, writing down some random thoughts.


[21/02/2023 2:57 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Once the others have left the area, Hemmer checks his leg to see if it was only a dream.  Finding the raw brand, he knows the vision was a visitation.  He picks up the cold metal symbol of Selune, and carries it outside in one hand with the steel relief of Hope in the other.   **"I have been visited by Gond.  I cannot let Hope's fire fade"**

Sergio wipes the sweat from his brow as he inspects his blade and armor after the practice. **"I think Hope stoked a fire in all of us. Up until now it seemed as if this were all fun and games. I realize now I need to be better - to try harder to protect those around me."**


[22/02/2023 6:00 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"The relief is a fitting tribute. Carry it until we return to Brisbandit, and I will give it a proper place in the Panache Company hall."**


[22/02/2023 6:07 AM] l33tb4c0n
He stands up and begins to secure his armor. He speaks with a pep to his actions, as of shaking off the gloom. **"Shall we begin our investigation of the other directions in which the roos seem to have fled? We have a half finished job."**


[22/02/2023 6:08 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I too feel something more after experiencing that loss. It stoked a fire in me that I believe will help drive me forward in combat. I feel plenty rested and ready to face what's ahead of us."** Tibalt stands up and readies all his equipment.


[22/02/2023 7:49 AM] WMDM
Kaleb comes around the side of the house with a bucket and mud all up his left side.  **"Hey.  Mornin' fellas.  I was wondering when you'd be up.  The missus usually puts on breakky about now."** As he speaks you all catch the waft of scent belying a delicious cooked breakfast.


[22/02/2023 7:53 AM] WMDM
Heading back into the house you are fed like only a grateful farmhouse can feed you on thickly cut bacon, large fried eggs, fresh bread with ample butter, grilled mushrooms, and fried onions.


[22/02/2023 7:56 AM] WMDM
On a side table you notice something that wasn't there last night.  A freshly oiled crossbow sits next to a quiver of rough looking bolts.


[22/02/2023 7:58 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Looking over at Kaleb.  **"planning on a bit of hunting later?"** tucking into the provided meal.


[22/02/2023 8:15 AM] WMDM
**"Nah not hunting mate, but if there's some critters about best to be prepared.  Haven't use that one for over a year though and there's a broken lever in the trigger mechanism.  I'm gonna have to spend some time fixin' her today."** Kaleb says through a mouthful of eggs.


[22/02/2023 8:17 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Finishing his bites of the meal he turns to Kaleb. **"Well, she's a thing of beauty. And being prepared is always a good idea. Do you have any fly-wire or barbed-wire for the top of your fencing that may be able to keep out critters you don't want? I'm not sure that would truly help against some of those giant spiders but it may be something to consider."**


[22/02/2023 8:19 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Standing up and walking around to the crossbow.  **"may I?"**


[22/02/2023 8:21 AM] WMDM
Kaleb nods at Hemmer.  **"Yeah go for it mate."** He give a nod to Tibalt as well.  **"Was thinking the same thing meself.  Most of that stuff got claimed to help build the wall around the city but there's still some around.  I'll have to see if I can get into town and see if there's any up for grabs."**


[22/02/2023 8:22 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt nods and pensively thinks before saying,**"So, I think we had seen tracks going off in other directions. Do you know how many roos may be out there still? Or what we may be looking at as far as those directions go?"**


[22/02/2023 8:25 AM] WMDM
**"So east is the creek, south is just plains.  Pretty dry."**


[22/02/2023 9:31 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Picking up the crossbow, turning it in different directions looking at the mechanism


[22/02/2023 9:57 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt looks to the others. **"Do you have a preference to which way we go first? If the plains are pretty dry, we may want to go that way first because we don't want the roos to get dehydrated and unable to make it back."**


[22/02/2023 10:07 AM] jvanblaricom0001
nodding as he looks over the weapon, **" that makes sense. Kaleb do you have any scrap metal laying about even old wire, I could work something up for barb wire"**


[22/02/2023 12:49 PM] WMDM
Hemmer can see that the sear, the small metal component that holds the bolt in place until the trigger is pulled, has broken.  Upon closer inspection you can see that the design of the crossbow is poor and the sear is going to be under too much tension when the bow is loaded and it's likely that the constant strain on the sear is the cause for the break.


[22/02/2023 12:52 PM] WMDM
Kaleb scratches behind his ear then nods and says, **"Yeah, we've got a bit of scrap metal and wire around here. I'll get one of the hands to gather it up for you, Hemmer."** He then turns to Tibalt and adds, **"I reckon you're right about the plains being your first stop. The roos near the creek should have plenty to eat and drink but the other's might be getting a bit parched by now."**


[22/02/2023 1:01 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Looking to Hemmer and Sergio, **"While they gather those supplies, shall we head to the plains and try to save as many roos as possible? I'm ready to head out if you two are."**


[22/02/2023 1:04 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer clutches his holy symbol and focuses on the sear while murmuring a prayer.  **" this will hold for now but it'll break again unless I can really sit down with it and change the design to take some of the stress off this piece"** pointing to the sear.


[22/02/2023 1:09 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding to Tibalt.  **" when we get back this evening I can use the ritual I used to create the relief of Hope on what ever scraps they have to get us some barbed wire. "** turning to Kaleb **"the metal you pull together doesn't have to be the useful for anything. "**


[22/02/2023 1:17 PM] WMDM
Kaleb takes the crossbow back and looks at it.  **"You beauty!  You've just saved me half a days work again!"**  Sharon bustles around the kitchen and produces a leather bag and hands it to you.  **"There ya' boys.  Least I can do for yous given what you're doin' for us.  Should keep yous fed till dinner."** The bag contains a loaf of bread and a fair amount of leftover bacon.


[22/02/2023 1:30 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"that fix won't last forever, but as long as you don't keep it under tension then it should be good.  I'll try to fix it tonight"**


[23/02/2023 3:23 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Checking all his gear one last time he grabs his cittern and with a serious look towards the direction of the plains pauses a quick moment. **"It's already feels weird without Hope here with us. But we will just have to bring Hope with us in other ways. We've got to do this. Thanks for your hospitality overnight Kaleb. I promise we 3 shall fight with a fervor to save as many of your Kangaroos as we can. Having spent a little time by them already today, I can see why they are important. Both a gentleness and a fierceness mixed into a single being. I would like to be that way too."** With that, Tibalt takes a few steps towards the path they will take when everyone is ready and just works on mentally preparing himself.


[23/02/2023 8:35 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio straightens his armor. **"Seeing as we are getting a bit of an earlier start, shall we investigate the plains? We may be able to make a good amount of progress before the sun gets too high."**


[23/02/2023 11:28 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Double checking his gear and ensuring he has enough water currently. **"That's definitely the idea. I just want to get there before it's too late for the roos because of the heat."**


[23/02/2023 11:52 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Picking up his shield and securing his weapons **"they don't seem quite as dumb as cattle, so that could bode well for them."**


[24/02/2023 12:39 PM] WMDM
As the party ventures forth onto the arid plains, Hemmer's keen eyes scan the ground for signs of their elusive quarry. His attention is drawn to the tracks, which are nearly imperceptible to the untrained eye. However, to Hemmer, they speak volumes - the depth and spacing of the prints reveal the weight and gait of the creature, while the slightest disturbances in the dirt hint at its direction and purpose.

The tracks are intermittent, as if the kangaroo has paused to rest or graze on the sparse vegetation, but Hemmer notes that they gradually lead further into the plains. As the party follows the tracks, the sun becomes hotter and hotter, beating down upon them relentlessly, and the dry air starts to parch their throats and sting their eyes.

As Hemmer diligently follows the tracks of the kangaroos across the dry and dusty plains, his sharp eyes catch something that causes him to stop in his tracks. He kneels down, examining the ground closely, and sees tracks that are twice the size of the normal ones.


[24/02/2023 1:37 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Hey guys you should see this"** tracing around the giant track.


[25/02/2023 1:03 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs walks up and takes a look closely at the track.  **"That's definitely not the same as what we were looking for, nor does that look like spider tracks."**


[25/02/2023 9:53 AM] WMDM
Tibalt sees one of the normal kangaroo tracks that Hemmer has been pointing out and comparing it to the new larger one can tell that it's made by a member of the same species, but the depth of the impression and slight differences indicate to him that it's perhaps a larger cousin of the presumably normal sized kangaroos they've already rescued.


[25/02/2023 1:05 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"Most interesting. Kaleb mentioned nothing of larger roos as part of his herd. Might these be? And might they be friend or foe?"**


[25/02/2023 2:48 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" maybe whatever made the spiders supersized got ahold of a roo"**


[26/02/2023 2:49 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Well, Kaleb didn't mention them for sure but if they are other roos we should be prepared for anything. Although if there is something around that makes us bigger... Sign me up. Hiking aside though, those bigger prints should be a little easier to follow."**


[26/02/2023 10:25 AM] WMDM
As the party trekked further into the arid plains, Hemmer continued to follow the tracks of the large kangaroo, leading them deeper into the unforgiving landscape. The sun beat down upon them relentlessly, and the dry air parched their throats and stung their eyes.

But then, in the distance, they spotted something unusual - a shimmering blue-green patch amidst the dusty, dry scrub. As they drew closer, they could hear the sound of flowing water, and their spirits lifted at the prospect of finding relief from the oppressive heat.

At the waterhole, they see a large group of kangaroos gathered, drinking from the cool water and nibbling on the lush greenery.  They can't help but notice the source of the tracks.  Not one, but two massive kangaroos standing protectively in front of the waterhole with fur as red as the setting sun. These creatures tower over the others, easily standing at least 10 feet tall.

As the party approaches the two large reds move between the party and the rest of the kangaroos in a protective way.


[26/02/2023 10:51 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" well hello there big guys, we aint here to hurt y'all. Just to lead ya back home"**


[26/02/2023 10:51 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer talks as soothingly as he can and keeps his hands in front of him and empty


[26/02/2023 11:41 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I'm going to look to the sides a bit to see if I can see a way around them."** Tibalt then walks to the right a little bit slowly and sees if there's any way to get behind them to maybe start coaxing them to head back to the farm.


[26/02/2023 2:54 PM] jameshurburgh
The big reds are cautious but let Hemmer approach and don't seem overly bothered by him.


[26/02/2023 10:24 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio surveys the scene as the others investigate. An oasis. Two overly large and overly protective kangaroos. Something seems odd about this.


[27/02/2023 5:27 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Quietly, "** Nice Job Hemmer. I'm still looking to see if there's anything else out here that may be dangerous or if there's a way to get behind them to herd them back towards the farm."**


[27/02/2023 5:41 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Nodding in acknowledgment of Tibs.  Continuing to work on the pair of big reds.


[27/02/2023 6:59 AM] WMDM
Sergio's insight into the behaviours of the roos and the situation in general allow him to surmise the following; It's likely that back at the farm the regular roos were spooked by the spiders and bolted.  Based on Hemmer's tracking it seems that they kept going in search of food and water and were at some point joined by the giant reds who probably led them here and are protecting them out of some sort species based instinct.  Additionally, you get the feeling that now that the big reds are protecting them, it's going to be tricky to get them separated.


[27/02/2023 11:02 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Well... at least it appears that these ones are safe. Convincing them to return is going to be tricky to say the least. And it seems preferable if we could avoid any fighting."**


[27/02/2023 11:31 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I got kicked my a little weak one, I don't want to find out what one of those healthy reds packs"**


[27/02/2023 11:44 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"And they do not seem to be a threat. It just may be difficult convincing them to let us bring any of the roos back to the farm."**


[27/02/2023 12:19 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I have a last resort idea. I could always create a fog cloud over the oasis to see if they will back away. Least favorite but still viable idea would also then to cast thunderclap on the side away from the roos to try and share them towards the farm. If only we had a good and water source we could be mobile with."**


[27/02/2023 12:21 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"think we could lead the big reds to Kaleb and the littles would follow?"**


[28/02/2023 12:30 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"We could give it a try.  Do you have any food they may be interested in? All I currently have for food is rations. I'm also trying to think if I have any songs or spells in my repertoire that may help in this situation as well."**


[28/02/2023 12:39 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I could try the berries again, but I don't get that many..."**


[28/02/2023 7:04 AM] WMDM
As you talk and seem to pose no threat the big reds both seem to make a decide you're not worth looking directly at and start slowly chewing on the grass again.  Sergio's rapier clinks off his armour and they look at him again, then after a minute go back to chewing slowly.


[28/02/2023 7:08 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt sees the Reds and thinks maybe he can befriend them.  He heard a song from one of the canines in Brisbandit and had actually been practicing it.  Hoping a song from their home may sound familiar to them and help with his animal friendship spell. https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=6dEqqzMIu5Y&feature=share

[28/02/2023 7:16 AM] WMDM
The two giant roos prick up their ears at the song and look at Tibalt, but go back to their eating.  If there was any reaction to the spell it wasn't obvious.


[28/02/2023 7:18 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt looks to Hemmer. **"Hey, they seem a little less antsy... can you make some of those berries so I can try to see if we can use them to start to lure them all back.  I'm thinking of having you and Sergio off on different sides and maybe get behind to make sure there are no stragglers and maybe occasionally make a small noise to hopefully push them forward"**


[28/02/2023 7:52 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Conjuring the berries in his hand, he offers one up to the nearest red


[1/03/2023 2:15 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt slowly walks towards Hemmer just in case there's a need.


[1/03/2023 2:17 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I'm not sure how Kaleb will feel if we bring these big reds back, but I can't imagine he will be too upset about a pair of protectors"**


[1/03/2023 2:19 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt nods. **"Especially if the rest of the roos willingly follow."**


[1/03/2023 2:37 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Hmm, protectors. Yes... creatures after my own heart! I will move to watch the back in case there are any stragglers. Hopefully the two of you can coax them away from the oasis."**


[1/03/2023 2:50 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Probably the best plan Sergio, might just stay back to not spook them to much"**


[1/03/2023 12:43 PM] WMDM
The large roos look ready to take the berries from Hemmer but continue chewing on the plentiful grass.  It seems they're content where they are and might need some more motivation to move.


[1/03/2023 12:47 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"do we have something that might give them more motivation?"**


[1/03/2023 12:51 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Offering a berry to one of the smaller roos to see if that will get them started


[1/03/2023 12:56 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I could try to play music, but I don't think that will do much. Or, I can always fog part of the area and see if that gets their attention to want to leave."**


[1/03/2023 12:58 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" fog might be the better option, prey animals don't like it when they can't see danger coming"**


[1/03/2023 1:00 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I could also make one of you fly to get over and maybe behind to make noise."**


[1/03/2023 1:00 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Sergio?"**


[1/03/2023 6:23 PM] WMDM
The large reds let Hemmer pass without issues and regular sized roos don't seem spooked by him, but they also seem content with the grass and leaves they're chewing on.


[2/03/2023 7:46 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt looks to Sergio.  **"Just think about flying. Think where you want to go and you will. You've got this. Once you are behind them and up about 25 feet so you will be above the fog cloud I will cast it just on the other side of them.  If they don't start moving right away, dip down just above the cloud and bang your shield or weapons together to make a little noise.  Hemmer and I will be up here in the front on either side with a few berries each trying to lure them with us if they start moving. "** Tibalt then begins to play a quick song on his cittern making Sergio fly.  https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=U-Ooxpz0Eqk&feature=share

slowly backing out of the middle of the group with the berry still being offered in an open hand


[2/03/2023 7:48 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt takes a few berries and does the same in the other direction towards the front and just at the side of the group preparing to create a fog cloud.


[2/03/2023 8:20 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio is a bit unsure, but he trusts Tibalt. He nods and begins floating slightly above and behind the herd. He readies his shield and sword, not for combat, but to make noise if needed.


[2/03/2023 8:20 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Seeing Sergio hitting the right spot begins playing a slightly haunting song as a small fog cloud starts appearing in the oasis just beyond the smaller roos. https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=9HfrxH6VtoI&feature=share

[3/03/2023 12:03 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Once the cloud song completes, Tibalt tries to get the attention of the roos using the berries and a soothing tone. **"Hey friends, I've got some berries and if you follow you will get them and find a safe place to stay."** Knowing they can't speak common he talks to them like they were a pet trying to infuse it with the sound of someone who cares greatly for them.


[3/03/2023 12:11 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Working the other side. Clicking at the roos like he would a cow or horse


[3/03/2023 6:03 PM] jameshurburgh
The roos seem unsure of the fog cloud appearing on the other side of the waterhole.  By luck a gentle breeze blows it towards the roos and as soon as it gets near them they seem to decide that it's not worth sticking around.  One of the regular roos hops towards the reds.  They wait a moment then start walking slow away from the fog and towards the party.  Seconds later, once the regular roos catch up, the pace quickens and suddenly the roos are hopping back the way they came as fast as they can.

[3/03/2023 11:38 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt seeing the fog take hold, and the Roos running towards the farm at a quick speed, shouts out to Sergio. **"Fly fast and make sure to keep track of where they are going. We will follow!"** And with that Tibs dashes after the roos hoping they are headed in the right direction.


[3/03/2023 11:58 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio calls out, **"Aye aye, my musical friend!"** Not being familiar with flying, he begins awkwardly kicking his legs in a half-running-half-swimming motion.


[4/03/2023 1:00 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer starts to run to try and keep within eyesight of the herd


[4/03/2023 1:47 AM] jameshurburgh
From Sergio's vantage he can see that the mob of roos is veering to the right and starting to head further north than the way they came.


[4/03/2023 1:50 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio eventually figures out flying, holding his sword pointed forward and flying like an arrow. He notices the kangaroos veering North and yells to his companions.


[4/03/2023 1:50 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"They are taking a turn right, toward the north!"


[4/03/2023 1:51 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio directs himself toward the north, hoping to get a bit ahead of them and make some noise


[4/03/2023 1:51 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt shouts as he's running changing course just a bit.  **"Try to get in front of them and see if you can make some noise up ahead of them to get them back on course!"**


[4/03/2023 1:52 AM] jameshurburgh
With the extra speed from the flight spell and his apparently natural aerodynamics, Sergio has no trouble getting in front of the mob.


[4/03/2023 1:56 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio begins banging his sword against his shield and yelling. **"Ho! Roos! Back away! Back!"**


[4/03/2023 2:14 AM] jameshurburgh
With that the mob correct course and begin heading back towards the farm.


[4/03/2023 2:22 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"That's it, just keep'em moving now gentlemen."** continuing to chase the roos as best he can. Hoping the sound of his mail and shield bumping keep them moving


[4/03/2023 8:19 PM] WMDM
The journey out took just over an hour, after around ten minutes of chasing the mob back towards the farm they you can see the roos and Sergio off in the distance getting further and further away from Hemmer and Tibalt.


[4/03/2023 11:19 PM] WMDM
Sergio's heart races as he herds the kangaroos to move together, their muscular bodies propelling them forward in a flurry of dust and wind. He feels the exhilaration of the flight spell coursing through his veins, giving him the ability to keep up with the fleet-footed marsupials. But suddenly, the spell comes to an end, and Sergio realizes with horror that he is plummeting towards the unforgiving red dirt below.

He flails his arms and legs, desperately trying to regain control, but it is too late. He hits the ground with a sickening thud, and his body bounces and tumbles over and over, kicking up a cloud of red dust as he goes. Pain shoots through his body as he finally comes to a stop, gasping for air and struggling to move.

Sergio groans as he sits up and tries to catch his breath. The impact with the ground had knocked the wind out of him, and pain shoots through his body with every movement. He takes a few deep breaths to steady himself and looks down at his sword. Horror and dismay wash over him as he sees that the scabbard is broken and the blade is bent.


[4/03/2023 11:35 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio pauses for a moment, wrapped up in the damage to his blade. However, he quickly shakes himself out of our and surveys the situation, looking toward the direction of the roos and then back toward where Hemmer and Tibalt should be.


[5/03/2023 12:44 AM] WMDM
Sergio can see Tibalt and Hemmer about half a kilometre away hurrying fast, in the other direction the roos are continuing, the large reds in the lead are still visible through small cloud of dust kicked up as the mob continues.


[5/03/2023 12:51 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer continues to run following the dust cloud.  Watching what looks like something fall out of the sky.  **" did the spell end?"**


[5/03/2023 11:55 AM] WMDM
As far as Sergio can tell the roos are continuing in the right direction to get to the farm.


[5/03/2023 12:00 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt looks ahead... looks at the sky... **"Ummm... yeah, forgot about that part.  I'm sure he's fine!!"**

{Reactions}
🤣

[5/03/2023 12:28 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"you forgot?  He looked like he was up pretty high. I don't think he bounces well"** continuing to run after the roos


[5/03/2023 12:38 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Well, I didn't think an hour in and wasn't expecting them to be running full out.  So yeah. I may have forgotten that one minor yet major detail. Hopefully he wasn;t more than 20 feet up, then it wouldn't be too detrimental to himself.  I'll make it up to him somehow."**


[5/03/2023 12:39 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" We should probably never mention it. He can be a bit prideful. "**


[5/03/2023 12:47 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
keeping pace with Hemmer, **"I think I may still need to apologize. It looks like he did a great job keeping them on task up until that point.  So lets hurry back to the farm and hopefully see them there."**


[5/03/2023 1:09 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Yea but after that we should probably not bring it up, unless he does. Good thing it seems like he's been moving them. "** trying to pick up the pace a bit to get back to Sergio


[5/03/2023 1:27 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio finds a nearby rock to sit on as he waits for his companions. He keeps an eye on the direction the herd was headed, but he needs time to get his wits about him after the fall. And he figures he can't do much more without the others.


[5/03/2023 1:33 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Finally getting caught up to Sergio. **" Looks like you got them going in the right direction. "**


[5/03/2023 1:38 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"Yes, though I got a bit wrapped up in the moment..."**
He looks to Hemmer and lifts his sword to show him. **"I am hoping your skills may be of use when we have time. This is... perhaps worse than any other injury I could have endured."**


[5/03/2023 1:43 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Reaching out and touching the sword at the bend. Letting a bit of Gond flow through him and into the steel.


[5/03/2023 1:43 PM] jvanblaricom0001
releasing the sword back to its normal shape.


[5/03/2023 1:50 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio's eyes widen. **"I expected you would require a forge and tools. This is... extraordinary! You have my deepest thanks, friend."**


[5/03/2023 1:52 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" To craft a new one that is the way. To fix something small, especially when we may be in need of it this way works well."**


[5/03/2023 1:52 PM] jvanblaricom0001
** I did the same for Kaleb's crossbow"**


[6/03/2023 8:15 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I apologize Sergio for not thinking about the hour limitation. I do however appreciate your incredible abilities you showed while flying. Who knows if the roos would have ventured way off track had it not been for you. Shall we continue on and hope to find them back at the farm?"** Tibalt stretches his legs quick, ready to pick up the pace again.


[6/03/2023 8:48 AM] WMDM
Hemmer, Tibalt, and Sergio return to the farm, the sun beating down upon them as they trudge through the dusty terrain. They are somewhat weary from their trek, but relieved to see Kaleb and the farm hands tending to the newly returned roos inside the fence.  There's no sign of the two big reds.

Kaleb and the farm hands look up as the adventurers approach. **"Welcome back, fellas,"** Kaleb calls out, grinning. **"Looks like you've had a bit of a rough go, ay?"** he says nodding to Sergio.


[6/03/2023 8:53 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"Yes, well... Let's just say I hope to keep my feet on the ground for a while."**


[6/03/2023 8:55 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio surveys the herd that has returned. **"We found this group by a watering hole and drove them back this way. They seem happy and healthy. But tell me, were there any larger ones with them upon their return?"**


[6/03/2023 8:55 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Handing a berry to each of his companions **" this should help a bit"**


[6/03/2023 8:56 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio takes the offered berry and eats it without hesitation.


[6/03/2023 8:57 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"guess the big reds decided not to join this mod?"**


[6/03/2023 8:59 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Well, shall we rest quick before going off in the third direction gentleman?"**


[7/03/2023 8:37 AM] WMDM
The sun isn't even at it's peak as you survey the roos settling back into their field.  **"Is that old waterhole running again?  It's been dry every time I've been there last couple'a years.  Well some good news at last!"** he says with a nod of approval.  **"We saw some reds when the mob was approaching yeah, but they scarpered off before they got close.  I thought about tryin' to round them up, but I decided I'd rather get these guys settled back in.  So what's the plan fellas?  The rate you're goin' you'll have the rest of the mob back by lunch."**


[7/03/2023 9:36 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I reckon will get a bit of water in us, and head back out to find that last batch. Those reds may come back they seemed to be guarding this lot. "**


[7/03/2023 10:45 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I think a quick rest before heading out should be good. Let's give Sergio a bit to recoup after that unfortunate fall. Other than that, yeah definitely a bit of cold water will help."**


[7/03/2023 12:13 PM] WMDM
Kaleb send the farm hand up to the house and starts heading up that way himself.  Once you get there his wife has some cool drinks ready on the front veranda and Kaleb plonks himself down on an easy chair and starts talking about the personality of the roos and the difference between kangaroo farming and other types of farming.  After half and hour he leaves you to it and gets back to work.


[8/03/2023 12:18 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"How are you feeling Sergio? You up to continuing on with our adventure now or do you need a little more time? Do you need me to heal you at all after that fall, or do you think you are OK? I've got your back no matter what."**


[8/03/2023 2:43 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"I am fine now that Hemmer has repaired my sword. Little more than my pride is hurt, and after a brief rest I should be fine."**


[8/03/2023 3:04 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Seeing Sergio looking a lot more relieved he stands up himself and grabs one more big drink of cold water.  **"So, shall we head out that third path now? I think we should all be steady after that reprieve."**


[8/03/2023 3:22 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Taking a few gulps of water and pouring the rest over his head. **" Lets see how many more of Kalebs roo's we can round up."**


[8/03/2023 12:27 PM] WMDM
The third set of tracks are easier to follow once the party sets out as the tracks are imprinted in dry dirt that hasn't been distrubed, soon they join a game trail.  Which heads steadily downhill and soon passes along side a small creek.  The path is strewn with rocks and branches, and the ground is uneven and damp. The sun beats down relentlessly even filtered through the trees, and the heat is stifling.

As the adventurers make their way through the bush, they pass by gnarled, twisted trees with peeling bark and spindly branches, and the occasional stand of tall, green grasses that rustle gently in the wind. The ground is a mosaic of browns and greens, covered in tufts of grass, shrubs, and wildflowers that bloom in brilliant reds, oranges, and yellows.

As they walk, the adventurers are serenaded by the sounds of the bush - the chirping of cicadas, the trilling of birds, and the occasional rustling of leaves as animals scurry away. The scent of eucalyptus and other native plants fills the air, and the occasional butterfly flits by, its wings shimmering in the sunlight.


[8/03/2023 12:46 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" It'd be a pretty place if it weren't for giant spiders "


[8/03/2023 12:52 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Those dingos we've seen were troublesome too. Bit this is definitely beautiful. The butterfly colors are spectacular!"**


[8/03/2023 1:00 PM] WMDM
Sergio and Hemmer are the first to see them on the other side of the creek.  There is a shallow rocky area where the roos are drinking, dipping their heads down to lap up the cool, refreshing water.


[8/03/2023 1:05 PM] WMDM
As the kangaroos peacefully drink from the stream, a giant toad as big as a cart, its skin sickly greenish-yellow, with patches of slimy, black algae clinging to its sides suddenly emerges from the water and snatches up a kangaroo in its jaws.  A split second later another appears and grabs a second roo before the rest of them turn and begin to scatter.


[8/03/2023 9:25 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Seeing the giant toads appear and grabbing roos, Tibalt quickly makes himself harder to hit turn before starting to move forward looks to Sergio. **"May your blade be quick today. Let's save these last round of roos!"**


[8/03/2023 10:06 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio smirks. Now THIS is the type of problem he can solve.


[8/03/2023 10:31 PM] l33tb4c0n
Seeing the roos in danger, Sergio rushes forward. He pushes himself, running faster than he has before, and clears the stream with no effort. He drives his blade straight into the toad.


[8/03/2023 10:33 PM] l33tb4c0n
The toad tries to bite him in a panic, but Sergio deftly avoids its jaws and uses the opportunity to swing at it again. Sadly, he misses.


[8/03/2023 10:57 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer rushes forward.  Calling forth a floating blacksmiths hammer


[9/03/2023 1:37 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt moves forward casting hex on the toad that Hemmer and Sergio have been targeting, striking it with a solid blow.


[9/03/2023 8:58 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio twists in the toad's grasp and delivers the killing blow to the first toad. Despite still being restrained, he gets a burst of adrenaline.


[9/03/2023 9:10 PM] WMDM
As the first toad falls dead it keeps moving and the roo it had eaten kicks it's way out, emerging with fur and skin burnt away by the toads acidic stomach.
The third toad hops over to Hemmer and fails to hit him, but the second takes another bite at Sergio a manages to hold one of his legs in it's horrid gaping maw.


[10/03/2023 12:52 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer swings wildly with his mace missing the toad. Calling on the floating blacksmiths hammer he falls to connect with it as well.


[10/03/2023 7:13 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt sees the next toad with a chomp on Sergio quickly switches his hex to it and moves in with a quick stab of his rapier.  Trying not to hit Sergio in the process he at least finds purchase on the toad doing a little damage.


[10/03/2023 7:30 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer's still a couple days off of 4


[10/03/2023 9:30 AM] WMDM
The escaped roo takes off towards the trees.  The third toad manages to get a grip on Hemmer and the second one fails to grasp Sergio after he escaped.


[10/03/2023 9:41 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer struggles to break free but fails. He calls the hammer to his aid landing a solid hit on the toad


[10/03/2023 9:55 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt has a hard time maneuvering around Sergio to find a clear spot to attack. Missing his shot he looks to Sergio. **"You got this friend!"**


[10/03/2023 12:09 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio takes his inspiration from Tibalt's words. He deftly hits back at the toad as it misses its bite, then takes a second, powerful swing at the toad. It doesn't go down, but it's clearly taken heavy damage.


[10/03/2023 12:10 PM] WMDM
The third toad deftly pulls Hemmer towards it then opens wider and swallows the cleric whole.


[10/03/2023 12:12 PM] WMDM
The second toad seems to decide it's had enough punishment for one day and turns to hop away before having it's side deftly sliced open by Tiablt's and Sergio's quick blades.


[10/03/2023 12:40 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer calls on Gond's strength and blows a hole through the toads back and crawls out sucking in gulps of air


[10/03/2023 12:59 PM] WMDM
From Sergio and Tibalt's perspective, the side of the toad facing them briefly glitters in a mystical dim light (which would make it easier to target) before exploding out in a shower of foul smelling toad guts.


[10/03/2023 1:06 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" son of a motherless goat, I don't know if this is going to wash off"** standing up and reaching back into the body for his mace


[10/03/2023 1:09 PM] WMDM
Tibalt can see the roos a short distance away in the trees.  They seemed to have stopped at a safe distance.


[10/03/2023 1:12 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
points to the roos. **"Shall we try the berries trick again Hemmer?"**


[10/03/2023 1:52 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Reaching into his pouch and fishing a few out. **" seems to have worked every other time"**


[10/03/2023 11:28 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibalt takes a couple berries from Hemmer too and starts to try and coax the roos out using soothing voice tones. *click click* **"Come on our little roos.  Let's get you home to your families"** and tries to help encourage them to start walking towards the farm.


[11/03/2023 2:40 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer tries to coax the roos, but the smell coming off him is too offensive to himself.  He backs off offering the berries to Sergio.  **"Im going to try and rinse this stench off"**


[11/03/2023 12:10 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio approaches Hemmer and is about to pat him on the back for a good fight, but pauses and thinks better of it. He awkwardly takes the berries and turns to the roos to try himself.


[11/03/2023 12:25 PM] WMDM
The roos still seem reluctant to approach.  Tibalt gets the impression they are still keen for a drink but for some reason they don't want to approach.


[11/03/2023 1:08 PM] WMDM
Hemmer's keen eyes spot one of the roos eying off the giant toad corpses nervously and starting to move further upstream where the toads aren't.


[11/03/2023 2:02 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Seeing the roos looking antsy towards the water and eyeing the toads, Tibalt quickly heads over to the closest corpse and casts levitate on it and quickly pushes it away trying to clear a path to the water for the roos.


[11/03/2023 2:04 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"great thinking on that Tibs."** Hemmer tries pulling the toad he climbed out of down stream from the roos


[11/03/2023 2:07 PM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
Tibs nods. **"I don't think I would want to drink next to these either."** Once the 2 toads are moved down stream, tibs quickly clicks to get the attention of the roos again then leans down and gets his face wet and takes a small drink of the water from the stream to hopefully encourage them.


[11/03/2023 2:33 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer wades out into the stream and tries to clean off as much of the toad innards as he can


[12/03/2023 2:45 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio continues to try to coax the roos with the berries. **"Let me know if there is anything else I can do. Animals are not my strong suit."**


[12/03/2023 2:49 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"I think we need to try to coax then and block them a bit from running a different direction than the farm. If you want to take the north side of them, I'll hang south a bit. Maybe Hemmer, when you are a bit more presentable, you can try to get easy of them to coax them towards the farm."**


[12/03/2023 10:46 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Sounds like a solid plan.  I'll work around behind them and give the shield a little rumble"**


[12/03/2023 11:24 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio nods and readies his shield. He briefly glances down at his scabbard, but thinks better of using his sword to bang against yet. He remembers what happened last time.


[12/03/2023 5:27 PM] WMDM
Once the giant toads are gone from the waterways the roos are happy to come back and take a drink, but they don't look ready to move yet.  After about five minutes of drinking and cool themselves though they begin to hop away and between the parties efforts you coral them back to the track leading back to the farm.  They seem far more relaxed than the mob at the water hole and you're able to keep up with them as they meander home.


[13/03/2023 4:52 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"You are some right proper roos. Think you will all be glad to be back home away from those toads, won't you? What do you think gentleman, besides those we lost to the spiders... Think we got them all now?"**


[13/03/2023 5:02 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I think we got all we can considering how many things want to eat them."**


[13/03/2023 6:02 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"True enough. I'm just glad you got out of that one. It was quite impressive. Gond should be proud of having you for a cleric. You honor him with your fervor both in and out of battle.


[13/03/2023 6:17 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"thank you.  I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a hot soak right about now. After that I'll have to find out how to get guts out of mail"**


[13/03/2023 6:29 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Perhaps there is a magic user that has some power that can clean things back in town. I personally would like another hour meal and a strong ale"**


[13/03/2023 6:41 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"As would I. Let us return to the farm and speak with Kaleb. Though don't forget, when we get back to town, we have the somber business of honoring Hope."**


[13/03/2023 9:18 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"We will honor Hope. Where I am from wakes are not a somber event."** looking over at Sergio **"when we get back to town its our duty to drink the town dry and tell the tails of Hope"**


[14/03/2023 12:18 AM] Tibalt (Air Genasi Bard: College of Valor)
**"Some day I will compose a ballad to his honor and the Hope he brought with him everywhere he went as well as the honor he brought to his town. I shall immortalize the Peanut Gallery in story or song!"** tibalt smiles thinking about all the possibilities.


[14/03/2023 8:45 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"arent the best songs written over a pint and a story?"**


[15/03/2023 11:47 AM] WMDM
The roos aren't in any particular hurry, but don't seem to mind being slowly herded back up the path and towards the farm.  Once you get in sight, the farm hands and Kaleb see you approaching and wait near the gate to usher them through.  The roos seem happy to follow the farmer.
Kaleb heaves a sigh of relief as the last of his beloved kangaroos hop back into the pen, safe and sound.
**"Good on ya, mates!"** Kaleb says with a grin. **"I was bloody worried sick about me roos. You lot are true blue legends for gettin' 'em back safe and sound. I owe ya a cold one, that's for sure!"** He slaps each of them on the back in turn, a broad smile on his face. **"I reckon we'll be able to sort out some fair dinkum payment for ya, too. Can't let ya go empty-handed after all the effort ya put in."**
Kaleb flashed a grin at the adventurers and gestured for them to follow him. **"C'mon mates, I'll take ya back to the homestead and we can have a few more beers to celebrate our success, eh?"**
