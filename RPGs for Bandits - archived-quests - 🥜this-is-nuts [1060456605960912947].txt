Outside the Heeler's house, Bandit McFlourish is talking with another canine who looks rather worried.


[5/01/2023 5:36 PM] Bandit
**"Yeah no worries mate.  We'll get someone to help sort it out ok?"**


[5/01/2023 5:41 PM] Greydan
**"Cheers Bluey mate.  Can always count on you ay."**


[5/01/2023 6:06 PM] deamonlord
Hope walks up to the Heeler house, watching the exchange take place before clearing his throat "pardon me, is there something you need help with?"


[5/01/2023 11:47 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt shows up just behind Hope after hearing that there may be something going on that needs help. **"Hello again their Mr. McFlourish.  I heard in the Cafe that there may be something going on that you could use some help with.  I know there are two others that also heard besides us that should hopefully be here shortly."**

Seeing the other gentleman standing by Bandit, Tibalt gives his bow and says, **"Pleasure to meat you too sir.  Tibalt Amhran at your service."**


[6/01/2023 12:06 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer steps out of the the house behind the big blue guy. **"I would offer assistance as well. "**


[6/01/2023 1:06 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio strolls up the path, having spent a day exploring the city. He waves to the assembling crew and notes @Jvan/Lorrus/Hemmer/Furnace  in particular. **"Hello again friends. It seems we have a new face joining us. I am THE Sergio Panache, swordsman - at your service!"** He turns to Bandit. **"Lord McFlourish, we have heard word that you have a particular job that we might be able to help with."**


[6/01/2023 1:14 AM] Bandit
**"You lot again.  Yeah righto.  Wow word gets out fast.  So I's just talkin' to Greydan here who runs a shop out of the big old peanut up north side.  He said it's nearly fallen down and he's looking for some help to prop it back up so he doesn't lose everything.  Whatd'ya reckon?  Yous able to go help him out?"**


[6/01/2023 1:15 AM] Greydan
Greydan's serious demeanour looks a little hopefully at Bandit's request and he looks at the assembled adventurers hopefully.


[6/01/2023 1:28 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer looks down at the swordsman. **" Hemmer, blacksmith.  Are you one of THE Panaches?  With the stories I heard, I'd have expected someone a bit taller"** Turning to the Big Blue Guy, **" I would be willing to go and see what can be done. Is the problem structural?"**


[6/01/2023 4:33 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio chuckles. **"Yes, I am indeed of that family. And what I lack in size, I make up for in skill. A blacksmith, you say? You and I shall have to discuss business when we have a chance."**

He turns to Bandit and Greydan. **"What is this talk of a... giant peanut? This land gets stranger and stranger by the moment. Is it grotesquely large because of some dark magic?"**


[6/01/2023 7:18 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt nods in agreement **"This is definitely strange, especially you mystically showing up here from who knows where.  However, we are definitely here both in interest of what happened as well as what we can do to help out."**


[6/01/2023 8:10 AM] Greydan
**"Dark magic?  Whatd'ya on about?  It's just a big peanut someone built.  For people to come look at.  Yeah I reckon there's some structural and non-structural problems mate.  Best if you come out an' have a gander yourself.  We're about a days walk northside."**


[6/01/2023 8:12 AM] Bandit
**"Sounds like you've got this one in the bag then.  Chalk up another problem solved by Bandit McFlourish!"** he strikes a pose before disappearing back into the house.


[6/01/2023 8:37 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt perks up.  **"A day's walk north? This sounds like the beginning of a fun story!"**


[6/01/2023 9:18 AM] deamonlord
"I haven't heard of a pee-nut before, but it sounds intriguing. We shall do what we can to help good sir."


[6/01/2023 12:41 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" a days walk you say? "** shifting his gear as he steps out around the Big Blue Guy.  **" Im fresh off the boat hopefully I have my land legs under me for this walk"**


[6/01/2023 5:52 PM] Greydan
**"Alright.  Well.  This way lads."** Greydan says simply and starts down the hill to the north.


[6/01/2023 5:52 PM] jameshurburgh
Sure enough you journey all day, travelling along a surprisingly wide solid path that Greydan refers to as the Gateway and mentions it's part of Bruce's way that goes all the way past Townsville, or at least it used to.  You head out through the northern land gates around noon and by sunset you can hear the waves of the ocean crashing some distance off to the east.


[6/01/2023 5:52 PM] Greydan
**"'Nother hour or so I reckon.  Do yous wanna camp here at the beach or keep on in the dark?  There aren't too many critters out this way along Bruce's way, but you never know when you're outside the walls."**


[6/01/2023 8:39 PM] deamonlord
"I believe it would be safer to take a rest for the night, though if  you want to keep moving I can provide light for us"


[6/01/2023 9:16 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt looks around. **"I'm fine continuing with the travel.  However, not knowing what we are going to be working with, it may be best to do it while it is light out."**


[6/01/2023 9:56 PM] Greydan
**"Well someone choose or we could just stand here talking like a bunch of gallahs."**


[7/01/2023 12:19 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" We stop.  No point in walking in the dark and bumping something that would normally leave us be. "** sitting down and removing the prosthetic leg.  **"walking on this all day is still a bit new for me"**


[7/01/2023 12:47 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt nods. **"Definitely need to be at our best and if that's making it difficult for you, I'm all in for stopping."** Tibalt unstraps his gear and leans back with his cittern out and decides to play a little ditty for everyone while they are prepping their spots.

[7/01/2023 2:41 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio works to prepare a small campfire, taking in the tune @DJ (Kah, Clare, Sk'ritch, Phan) plays and even humming along at times. After some time he turns to @Jvan/Lorrus/Hemmer/Furnace. **"Pardon me for being so blunt, but you clearly have seen much action on your time. May I ask what happened?"** He motions toward his leg. **"I am always curious to trade tales with fellow warriors."**


[7/01/2023 2:52 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer checks over the wrappings and replaces the prosthetic. **" I could spin you a yarn about losing it in a great battle. If you'd like"** Looking over at @Steve (Sergio/Sanaar/Zeph) **" I think he's better at that though"** indicating @DJ (Kah, Clare, Sk'ritch, Phan) with his chin. **"Its nothing so impressive as that though, it was crushed just below the knee buy an anvil, The priests of Gond gave me the option of amputation or dying'**


[7/01/2023 10:15 AM] deamonlord
Hope nods to each of them before setting his pack down "If it's Salrite with you guys, I can go and see if I can find some fresh water and food for dinner, fresh is best as Mama used to say"


[7/01/2023 11:50 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio looks to Hemmer. **"You sell yourself short. Much as I may battle with a blade, you battle with fire and steel to bring forth great creations. And battles can have casualties. But I'm sure you have brought much good to this world through your trade, and so I thank you."**


[7/01/2023 12:01 PM] l33tb4c0n
He turns to Greydan. **"Tell me, grey one, what can we expect when we reach the peanut? I understand that this land's abrupt... arrival here has created done chaos. But you and Lord McFlourish speak as though this is a simple fix up. Is there a reason the peanut has fallen into disarray? Anything we can expect upon arriving?"**


[7/01/2023 1:25 PM] Greydan
**"Well I thought it wasn't too bad at first so I moved in and made a little way point for the few fellas wanting to travel north, but it's been starting to creak and groan and tip over to one side.  Another good storm and it'll probably go down."** he says looking worried.


[7/01/2023 1:27 PM] jameshurburgh
There is a surprisingly flat area near the beach to  camp, the waves can be heard just over a sand bank and a small estuary provides relatively fresh water.  ( @Greg/Cinder/Leyana do you want to roll survival to see what you can find? )

[7/01/2023 1:42 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"While we have not seen much in the way of danger, it never hurts to be on guard. Speaking of which, we should discuss keeping watch overnight. I will gladly take first watch, if someone else would be willing to give me some relief in the early morning."**


[7/01/2023 1:46 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt stops playing and sets his cittern down. **"I will gladly take part in one of the watches."**


[7/01/2023 1:47 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"I will take the dawn watch as I perform my daily prayers to Gond when the sky looks like a newly lit forge"**


[7/01/2023 2:40 PM] deamonlord
Hope travels to the estuary, looking to see what he can find for the group (Yeah, I'll see what I can find @Big Jim (DM): Dhan'ya Syl Kher )


[7/01/2023 4:40 PM] jameshurburgh
In the shallow mud of the estuary Hope is able to find a few shellfish hiding in holes.  After an hour of digging he manages to collect enough to make a meal for one, or to supplement the rations everyone else is eating.


[7/01/2023 4:50 PM] Greydan
**"Yeah good call mate.  I'll keep a watch as well, put me down for second.  Make sure yous keep an eye on the trees for dropbears as well ay.  They usually wait till you're right under them, but you never know."** Greydan adds.


[7/01/2023 6:14 PM] deamonlord
"Sweet, won't be much, but at least we won't be eating just rations tonight." Hope brings his haul back to camp for everyone.  "So what's the plan? What did I miss?"


[8/01/2023 12:50 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Drop bears?"**


[8/01/2023 9:31 AM] Greydan
**"Dropbears."** Says Greydan seriously.  **"I came across them a couple of months ago.  I was late home one day and decided to take a shortcut through the bush.  I followed this track once or twice in the day time, but never at night.  Well the trees grow real close in that part of the bush and the tree branches were brushing against me face as was hurryin' along the path then out of nowhere something smacked me in the face and knocked me flat on me back."** He pauses and looks around to make sure everyone's listening  **"Well as I lay there rubbin' me nose that's when I realised all the cicadas and night animals had gone silent.  Except that's when I heard a loud crack in the branches above me.  Well I didn't hang around to see what it was I got my butt out of there as fast as I could more branches and trees crackin' and breakin' behind me as I ran.  I felt somethin' swipe at my back and things thumpin' all round in the bush and just in time I made it out and back to the main road."** He leans back and takes a breath.
**"As I looked back into the bush I saw eyes.  Red glowing eyes in the bush.  Just lookin' at me.  Then they disappeared."** He shudders a little.

**"And that fellas.  It what dropbears are.  These are some good yabbies you got there mate.  Good tucker."** He says to Hope indicating the food he'd brought back from the beach.


[8/01/2023 9:33 AM] jvanblaricom0001
nodding as if he understood anything that just got said. **"so they are dangerous, and will attack?"**


[8/01/2023 9:41 AM] Greydan
**"Sure will mate."**


[8/01/2023 9:42 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt looks around trying to digest what was just said **"I've definitely got to remember this for my stories!!"**


[8/01/2023 9:43 AM] jameshurburgh
Just by the way he talks everyone get's the feeling that the story is true-ish, but also that Greydan is a bit of a story teller and has probably embellished the facts for the sake of the story.


[8/01/2023 9:44 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**"and the live in the trees? how big would you say they grow to?"**


[8/01/2023 9:46 AM] Greydan
**"Aww pretty big mate."** he waves his hands around as if trying to show the size and it looks they could be anywhere from two to four feet.


[8/01/2023 9:46 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" are they good eating?"**


[8/01/2023 9:47 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" do they have a pretty pelt to turn into some high fashion item? or poison claws and teeth that a wizard would find useful?"**


[8/01/2023 9:48 AM] Greydan
**"No bloody idea mate.  I've never got close enough to see one up close let alone eat 'im."** He gives a laugh as if you're crazy for suggesting it.


[8/01/2023 9:48 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt leans in closer. **"I've seen the occasional brown bear climb a bit up a tree. Would this be like those? And are they drop bears because they drop on you... Or because they drop stuff on you?"**


[8/01/2023 9:49 AM] Greydan
**"Nah they drop on you for sure.  And it's their long claws that'll mess you up.  They reckon they're related to koala's if you've seen them."**


[8/01/2023 9:50 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" what's a koala?"**


[8/01/2023 10:06 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"I have traveled to many exotic places, but I cannot say I've ever encountered a creature as you describe, this... coo-ah-la."** Sergio looks a bit more carefully at the trees above them.


[8/01/2023 10:08 AM] Greydan
**"Hmmm.  Yous are green aren'tcha?  There like bears but they're not and they pretty much sleep all day and eat eucalyptus leaves but they've got big claws for climbin' and you don't want them deciding to climb you."**


[8/01/2023 10:10 AM] jvanblaricom0001
**" Eucaliptas leaves? Not a plant I've ever heard of. I don't believe we have these bears on the Sword Coast"**


[8/01/2023 12:05 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"Well, perhaps we should get to rest and begin our watches. I will keep the fire burning. Hopefully, like many of the beasts I have encountered, it will keep these dropping bears at bay."**


[8/01/2023 1:15 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt grabs his pack and leans against it and closes his eyes. Music playing in his mind, he quickly falls asleep.


[8/01/2023 1:41 PM] jameshurburgh
About an hour into @Steve (Sergio/Sanaar/Zeph)'s watch he hears thunder in the distance inland and the sky lights up with flashes of lightning.  Sure enough half an hour later a pattering of rain approaches and washes over the camp blowing loose items around and getting everyone damp and wet.  Thankfully it passes as soon as it came and the hardpacked ground drains the excess water easily off into the estuary and everyone is able to resume their rest.


[8/01/2023 1:46 PM] jameshurburgh
Greydan and Tibalt's watches pass without incident.
As the first faint hint of the light of dawn touches the sky @Jvan/Lorrus/Hemmer/Furnace hears a faint clacking sound coming from the direction of the ocean, looking at the sandy path he sees a giant crab approaching from the beach about 30 ft. from the camp.

Hemmer Bairn casts Searing Smite!
Hemmer Bairn
**Effect**: Searing Weapon [10 rounds] (Attack: Searing Smite; Parent: Searing Smite)
Effect
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.

[9/01/2023 10:58 AM] l33tb4c0n

[9/01/2023 11:02 AM] l33tb4c0n
The joint cracks and breaks with only a bit of resistance. Sergio walks over to the fire and lays it across. **"We may not have much in the way of seasonings, but crab meat is still crab meat. Best not to let it go to waste."**

[9/01/2023 1:58 PM] jameshurburgh
After eating and packing up camp Greydan leads you on.  You travel inland and quickly find Bruce's way which let's you travel north easily.  The water is pooled in some places from last nights storm and you see the occasional branch freshly downed branch indicating the strength of winds and Greydan begins to look worried.


[9/01/2023 2:02 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" reckon that wind was strong enough to knock down your peanut?"** looking over at Greydan


[9/01/2023 10:41 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio looks puzzled. **"Surely not? It was a storm for sure, but far from the worst I've ever seen.  Though... it did seem to come upon us quickly. Are storms out of the ordinary for this area?"**


[9/01/2023 11:54 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt nods. **"If this is anything like the areas of the sword coast that I've experienced east of here, I would absolutely say storms like that can pick up and knock off pretty quick. Keeps the area green, which is always nice to see.  Though downing branches doesn't mean much. If we were to see trees down, that's a completely different story."**


[10/01/2023 8:20 AM] Greydan
**"Look it was no cyclone, but yeah I am worried about the peanut.  Storms can blow in from inland pretty quick sometimes."**


[10/01/2023 8:58 AM] jameshurburgh
After another hour of walking you come across a small encampment.


[10/01/2023 8:58 AM] Greydan
**"Ooh no no no.  Oh biscuits, it's gone down!"**


[10/01/2023 9:01 AM] jameshurburgh
Ahead of you, you can see a large peanut lying sideways on the ground around 50 feet long (which would have been tall) and 25 feet across.  Surrounding the peanut are various tents and shacks scavenged from the ruins of the old world.  There are around fifteen other canines milling around, looking at the damaged peanut and trying to clean up bit of loose debris.


[10/01/2023 9:06 AM] jameshurburgh
One of the locals approaches **"Greydan!  You're back.  So sorry mate, the whole thing went down last night in that storm that blew over.  We've been doing what we can, but the whole thing is pretty darn heavy."**


[10/01/2023 9:07 AM] Greydan
Greydan gives a big sigh. **"Yeah.  No worries mate.  Look I got these blokes from Brisbandit.  Bandit reckons they'll be able to help out."**


[10/01/2023 9:09 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt walks around closer to Greydan trying to see what kind of support system this thing was using and looking for any ideas he may be able to offer for possible restoration or renovation.


[10/01/2023 9:13 AM] jameshurburgh
There is a combination of bent metal supports and wooden planks and trees around the peanut that look like they were once supporting it.  (Roll Investigation if you want to know more.)


[10/01/2023 9:39 AM] deamonlord
Hope looks at the accumulated individuals and wanders over, resting his hand upon the giant peanut. "This must have been quite the sight back in the day"


[10/01/2023 10:35 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio walks up next to Hope. **"This truly is quite the nut. I admit I was not sure what to expect."**


[10/01/2023 10:40 AM] l33tb4c0n
He turns to Greydan. **"Well, we came here to help, and we will if we can. But, aside from our blacksmith friend, I'm not sure what skills we can offer that your crew does not already have."**


[10/01/2023 12:06 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt thinks for a minute and looks to Greydan. **"Depending on how heavy that is, if we get the sports fixed, I might have a way to get it upright again."**


[10/01/2023 12:17 PM] tkleprechaun
Walking closer, Tibalt realizes just how big this is. **"On second thought, I don't think I could do that. However, I would love to help in any way possible."**


[10/01/2023 12:18 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"Greydan, how did you and your company get it upright in the first place?""**


[10/01/2023 12:20 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"I'm still not convinced a nut of this size is not the product of some sort of magic."**


[10/01/2023 12:49 PM] Greydan
**"Well it was built before the Sundering.  You can see some of the original supports still there and it was still standing but abandoned when we found it.  We added some wooden supports and whatever we could, but it looks like it just wasn't enough.  Struth.  If it weren't for those damn spiders we might be able to get some of the leftover supports from the yard inland."**


[10/01/2023 12:50 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt perks up. **"Spiders? What's wrong with spiders? I like that they eat the annoying bugs that bite and sting."**


[10/01/2023 12:55 PM] Greydan
**"Yeah but something happened after the Sundering.  They've gotten bigger than before.  Ya can't just hit 'em with a rolled up newspaper anymore, so we mostly just keep away.  Hey wait a minute yous dealt with those crabs pretty easy peasy.  Maybe you could deal with the spiders too!"**


[10/01/2023 12:56 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt looks to the others. **'Well, I'm up for helping if you gentlemen are. This is turning out to be quite the story!!"**


[10/01/2023 1:01 PM] deamonlord
"We have agreed to aid in any way we can, if squashing these new spiders is of help then it is our duty"


[10/01/2023 1:04 PM] Greydan
**"Right.  Well.  I'm not coming with ya if that's salrite with you.  But I'll point yous in the right direction ay."**


[10/01/2023 1:04 PM] deamonlord
"What does me being with them have to do with it?"


[10/01/2023 1:06 PM] Greydan
**"What?  You're going with them aren't ya?  Hope's not too much trouble."**


[10/01/2023 1:06 PM] deamonlord
"Yes, but you said you weren't going if I'm with them?"


[10/01/2023 1:09 PM] Greydan

[10/01/2023 1:09 PM] tkleprechaun
**"It's fine Hope, he was sleeping the words together a bit for it's alright. Salrite. I think we will be fine Greydan, point the way."**


[10/01/2023 1:11 PM] jameshurburgh
Greydan leads you inland along an overgrown road for about half an hour and after awhile points you over the hill and stops.  You eventually come to a large flat area with long metal poles scattered all over the ground.  These seem to be clearly what Greydan was hoping to use for his supports.


[10/01/2023 1:12 PM] jameshurburgh
It's easy to see why they haven't yet been retrieved though.  The entire area is covered in thick sticky webs.


[10/01/2023 1:20 PM] tkleprechaun

[10/01/2023 3:21 PM] deamonlord
"I have a tinderbox we can use to make some torches to give us some length"


[10/01/2023 3:56 PM] jameshurburgh
(Tibalt remembers hearing songs about giant spiders that would be able to sense when anyone was on it's web.  He also recalls overhearing someone back in Brisbandit mentioning that local spiders were venomous and to watch out for them.)


[10/01/2023 4:20 PM] jameshurburgh
(Looking at the webs, Hope figures out that they are forming a few different funnels, it would seem, to trap food.  If the party positioned themselves correctly, any spiders escaping from the webbing might be partially trapped.  Thought spiders are well known for their ability to climb over things.)


[10/01/2023 4:22 PM] deamonlord
Hope passes this info to the group


[10/01/2023 9:20 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"I like Hemmer's suggestion of fire. Rare is the beast that is not fearful of flames. Perhaps we should simply light the webbing from afar and watch what emerges."**


[11/01/2023 12:15 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt isn't sure which way he wants to do things. **"Well, If we want to just pluck some strings or maybe drop the fire closer to the funnel, I can cast mage hand and carry a torch out further with it. Otherwise, I could cast thunderwave towards them and see what shakes up from there too. We may have the ability to conceal the area in fog for one or two of them.  Or instead of that, I can grant the ability to fly to one of us to allow them to reach a spider that may be out of reach."**


[11/01/2023 12:54 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"I prefer any of these plans - let's prepare ourselves and agitate it from a distance. Perhaps we can even hide somewhere. But it would be better for us to be on the defense here- we don't know how many there are in there, and I don't want to find out while we're on their turf."** He pulls his shield off his back and draws his sword, readying himself to defend the group.


[11/01/2023 4:35 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt pulls his cittern out to ready a few things and thinks of a few inspirational points for the team before they begin. (When we are all in initiative but before it starts I will give an inspiration die to you 3 and here's the inspirational speech) **"Sergio, may your shield be steady and your blade strike true.  Hope, may your God watch over you while you protect us. Hemmer, my the blessings of the forge ring true like hammer on anvil. We shall do what we must to accomplish this and restore order! As we prepare for the battle, let us prepare for success."**


[11/01/2023 6:51 AM] jameshurburgh
(Hope and Sergio both looking for anything that would prove useful tactically figure out that if they can manage to light webs on either side of a sort of empty corridor, it could possibly force the spider's into a choke point if they're trying to escape.  However anyone who's tried to catch a spider would know that expecting spiders to go exactly where you want them to and not crawl up the wall at the last minute isn't exactly a science)


[11/01/2023 6:57 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio steps forward to outline a plan. **"We shall set ourselves up at a reasonable distance from the center of the nest. @DJ (Kah, Clare, Sk'ritch, Phan) , I like your idea of using for magics to guide you torch. If you can light to the right, @Jvan/Lorrus/Hemmer/Furnace can light to the left. @Greg/Cinder/Leyana , save your sacred flames - we may have need of a bigger burn. This should hopefully stir the nest and allow us to see how many are inside. From a distance, We may avoid their immediate notice, but my shield and blade are ready to meet any that come our way. Greydan, you should hang back."**


[11/01/2023 6:58 AM] jameshurburgh
(Greydan is back over the hill behind you)


[11/01/2023 6:59 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio realizes the dog is already gone. **"I see he is familiar with this tactic."**


[11/01/2023 7:03 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt nods. **"It's as fine a plan as any we could come up with.  We shall prep quickly and go when all are ready"**


[11/01/2023 7:09 AM] tkleprechaun
**"Though I must warn you that we must be careful as there is a strong chance these could be venomous, and quite possibly gigantic based on this webbing, based on stories I heard around town"**


[12/01/2023 7:37 AM] tkleprechaun
**"Ok, I think we are ready. I will take a torch over to a spot with my mage hand and Hemmer use the bonfire.  I saw we aim just past where they are and just outside to see if we can 'funnel' them into the center."** Tibalt chuckles about his little funnel web pun.


[12/01/2023 8:41 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio positions himself in front of the others and raises his shield. He readies his sword for action as the others move to light their fires.


[12/01/2023 9:17 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer settles his shield infront of him calling forth a bon fire at the junction of to 2 funnels


[12/01/2023 10:01 AM] deamonlord
Hope will clasp his holy symbol and ready himself for the spiders to appear


[12/01/2023 11:31 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt moves a bit forward and grabs a torch with his mage hand and pushes it out to a point ready to drop it as soon as the bonfire starts. <S21>


[12/01/2023 11:39 AM] tkleprechaun
So I guess that is for prep round?


[12/01/2023 12:17 PM] jameshurburgh
As the bonfire ignite and the torch is dropped into the web, it immediately starts to unravel, revealing 3 Giant Spiders.


[12/01/2023 1:11 PM] l33tb4c0n
As the spiders skitter toward then, Sergio leaps into action. Before anyone can blink, he thrusts forward and strikes the first spider cleanly between it's many eyes. It drops without even a sound.


[12/01/2023 1:13 PM] l33tb4c0n
However, overconfident from a clean kill, Sergio is too slow on his next attack. The second spider is now ready, and dodges his attack. Sergio curses.


[12/01/2023 2:54 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**"Gond will guide you Sergio"** allowing the fire to work on its own.


[12/01/2023 3:11 PM] deamonlord
Hope calls down his sacred fire onto the second spider, but gets distracted by the many eyes


[12/01/2023 6:04 PM] jameshurburgh
The second spider quickly scurries away from where the scared flame comes down and looks ready to pounce on Sergio.


[12/01/2023 9:12 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt seeing the second spider approaching running away from the bonfire quickly drops the mage hand pulling out his rapier. With a deft thrust, he pierces the giant spider right through the heart as it tries to scurry back away from Hope's sacred flames watching it instantly fall backwards.


[12/01/2023 9:50 PM] l33tb4c0n
**"Excellent job my friend!"**


[13/01/2023 12:11 AM] jameshurburgh
Third spider quickly moves forward and at the same time a fourth spider appears near the back of one of the undisturbed webs.


[13/01/2023 12:24 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio lunges toward the third spider as it moves toward the group. His rapier pierces its side. It screeches in pain and flails, but remains standing.


[13/01/2023 12:46 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer moves up blocking the path of the 3rd spider, holding his shield at the ready, smashes down on the creatures face with his mace spraying ichor out on to the grass


[13/01/2023 1:08 AM] deamonlord
"Well, that's a gory sight."


[13/01/2023 1:35 AM] tkleprechaun
As Tibalt is moving forward he pats Sergio on the shoulder **"Your blade is as swift and strong as you say and it is an honor to fight alongside you."**


[13/01/2023 7:18 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt finds the closest spot he thinks is safe and casts thunderwave to try to at least knock out part of the spider/webbing that's yet to be seen.


[13/01/2023 9:06 AM] jameshurburgh
As the webbing starts shaking it seems fairly undamaged, but with the webbing another black figure emerges.


[13/01/2023 9:07 AM] jameshurburgh
To the south west the spider crawls forward near the flaming web, but then retreats back into it's on funnel..


[13/01/2023 11:52 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio is inspired by the bards bravery, watching him rush headlong into the webbing. Sergio readies his shield and blade and runs to stand beside Tibault, watching the injured spider as it retreats to its web.


[13/01/2023 11:54 AM] l33tb4c0n
**"My friend, I dare say you are as brave as I. Let us slay this beast together!"**


[13/01/2023 12:49 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Rushing forward to hold the line between Sergio and Tibalt.  **" If it gets close it will regret it"**


[14/01/2023 2:55 AM] deamonlord
hope turns to the spider in front of the others, and gripping his holy symbol tight, draws a bead of blood and flings the droplet towards, invoking his goddess as it shoots fowards, landing and burning into the spiders form


[14/01/2023 3:02 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt finishes off the spider that was in front of him and starts noisily crashing through the woods to attract anything else out in hopes to making sure they get all the spiders.


[14/01/2023 9:18 AM] jameshurburgh
The last spider creeps forward and aims a bite at Tibalt which he's able to easily dodge.


[14/01/2023 9:24 AM] l33tb4c0n
Seeing the spider swing at Tibalt, Sergio leaps into action. Inspired by the bard's words, he rushes forward to place himself alongside the bard. The precision of his blade surprises even Sergio, as the spider goes motionless -impaled by his rapier  cleanly through the head.


[14/01/2023 9:29 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio takes a moment to catch his breath, then shouts to the others, **"Burn the rest of the webs. Though this was a solid victory, I will not relax until we are sure there are no more horrors in the nests."**


[14/01/2023 9:31 AM] jameshurburgh
As the last giant spider stops twitching and flames of the already burning webs begin to die out.  The forest goes back to normal, and you see even more clearly well form shafts of metal that would be most useful to prop up a giant peanut.


[14/01/2023 9:34 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt runs back to grab Greydan. **"It appears the spider problem is cleared. The metal supports seem in great condition!"**


[14/01/2023 9:36 AM] Greydan
**"Crikey!  Already?  Are you sure?  Those spiders seemed pretty nasty and they could be hiding anywhere?"**


[14/01/2023 9:41 AM] tkleprechaun
**"We burned most of the webbing and we were definitely not quiet about it trying to draw everything hostile towards us."**


[14/01/2023 10:04 AM] Greydan
**"Yeah.  Righto.  Well if you think it's safe."** Greydan follows you to the clearing and looks around nervously.  Seeing the metal poles he get's excited though.
**"Oooh you beauty.  This is just what we need!  Should make  the peanut more solid than a wombat.  So how're we gonna get them back to the camp?"**


[14/01/2023 10:31 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio is busy cleaning his blade with a spare cloth. He looks to the spider next to him and thinks. Then, with a quick slice, he severs the head. He cradles it in the cloth and slings it over his back. **"Well, I would think the first step to moving these might be to enlist as much help as we can. Greydan, I will head back to the peanut and gather as many as I can to assist. Seeing this..."** He jostles the trophy on his back - **"Might help to raise spirits that the threat is now gone. I shall leave the rest of you to figure out some clever engineering while I'm away."** He begins jogging at a brisk pace back toward the peanut and quickly disappears down the trail.


[14/01/2023 10:35 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt searches and finds a board big enough to put some supports on and levitates it to help get them closer to the peanut.


[14/01/2023 10:36 AM] deamonlord
As they work around, Hope tries to cut out some of the fangs for future ideas, before walking over to the group to see how he can help


[14/01/2023 10:47 AM] l33tb4c0n
About an hour later, Sergio arrives at the peanut. He waltzes into to the camp with his usual bluster and bravado, making a show of tossing the dead arachnid head to the ground in view of most of the people. He spins an embellished tale of the battle to the crowd. Some of the more grizzled members of the audience seem hesitant, but it's hard to argue with the evidence staring them straight in the face with it's many now-lifeless eyes.  He rouses their spirits and speaks about how they can once again raise their once-busted nut. Eventually, Sergio leads a sizeable group back toward the clearing, leaving just a few behind to tend the camp.


[14/01/2023 10:54 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt music not only helps lift a lot of the weight, it has also been seen that it is lifting spirits too. All the workers are moving faster and with purpose add the music floats through the air around them.


[14/01/2023 10:55 AM] deamonlord
Hope tries to help lift some of the poles, but twists the wrong way, falling on his face


[14/01/2023 1:12 PM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer starts to dig through the supports to see if anything is viable to use in getting the peanut back upright and stable


[14/01/2023 2:19 PM] tkleprechaun
Once the supplies are in place and the peanut is being put right, Tibalt cast fly on himself to help attack supports and ropes higher up.


[14/01/2023 2:33 PM] jameshurburgh
With help from the locals the party bring the supports back to the peanut and lift it back into place with a crunch.  The locals lift the supports into place and Tibalt flies up to attach the higher sections with a gasp of surprise from the onlookers.  A cheer goes up from the crowd as it's obvious it's not going to suddenly fall down again.


[14/01/2023 2:34 PM] Greydan
**"Well that's bloody great you lot.  You've sure done a beaut' job fellas."** Greydan says clapping you each on the back.


[14/01/2023 2:36 PM] jameshurburgh
As the locals are milling around thanking you and trying to get a glimpse of your weapons and equipment, there's suddenly a scream from the north.  **"HELP!  HELP!!!"**
A young female canine scurries into town.  **"Dingoes!  A really big one as well!"**  She yells.  Everyone scatters or grabs tools or weapons.


[14/01/2023 2:37 PM] jameshurburgh
A few seconds later two dingos lope into the settlement looking hungry.  One of them massive, the other normal sized.


[14/01/2023 2:38 PM] deamonlord
"happy to help, though they did ... Bloody hell!"


[14/01/2023 2:46 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt straps his cittern to his back again and maintains himself aloft watching for the incoming dingos.


[14/01/2023 11:06 PM] tkleprechaun
Seeing the others getting ready to fight Tibalt lands placing himself at the back making sure all the innocent people are getting fat enough away while making sure he is ready for any incoming dingos that approach him.


[14/01/2023 11:14 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio draws his blade. **"A Ha! You are lucky today, people of the nut! For your get to see The Boisterous Blade in action for yourselves!"**


[15/01/2023 1:11 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio steps forward and engages the larger Dingo. He slashes at the beast a connects with a solid attack, but the beast is only marginally phased.


[15/01/2023 5:30 AM] deamonlord
Hope grabs a ration and holds it out to the second dingo, palm up as he slowly creeps forward


[15/01/2023 8:44 AM] jameshurburgh
The larger beast retaliates snapping at Sergio without connecting.


[15/01/2023 8:48 AM] jameshurburgh
The smaller dingo seems interested in the offered ration but at the last second seems to decide the hand holding it looks like a more delicious meal.  He pulls, shredding Hope's hand but Hope manages to break free before he's pulled to the ground.


[15/01/2023 8:54 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt rushes forward joining Sergio attaching the bigger dingo landing another good solid hit. **"Let's get this big one taken care of. Quick work from your quick blade!"**


[15/01/2023 11:14 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer rushes the large one and swings wild wilt his mace.  When it doesn't connect he sends a healing prayer out to Hope.


[15/01/2023 11:25 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio slashes again at the larger one, landing another blow and causing the dingo to stagger a bit. A cocky smirk crosses his face.


[15/01/2023 11:30 AM] deamonlord
Hope cries out in pain, grimicing at the wound, before flashing a smile to Hemmer in thanks. growling at the dingo who had bit him, he calls out to the skies, striking it down asleep


[15/01/2023 11:31 AM] jameshurburgh
Trying to recover from Sergio's brutal the Dire Dingo snaps back at him but stumbles.


[15/01/2023 11:34 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt takes another swing at the big dingo and swings wide as it shifts trying to bite at Sergio.


[15/01/2023 11:38 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Hemmer swings at the beast, missing wildly.


[15/01/2023 11:48 AM] l33tb4c0n
With a flourish, Sergio makes a graceful stab at the larger Dingo, piercing its heart. He smoothly pulls his blade out as the beast keels over and twirls a bit to make his cape billow ever so slightly. He puffs his chest out and points his blade directly at the second dingo. **"And now... for YOU!"**


[15/01/2023 11:52 AM] jameshurburgh
The larger dingo slumps to the ground dead.  The other one lays still, it's chest moving up and down slowly as it breathes.


[15/01/2023 12:05 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio feels a bit embarrassed at his threat upon realizing the second dingo is sound asleep, but still tries to play it off as cool.


[15/01/2023 12:12 PM] deamonlord
hope calmly aproaches the remaining dingo, setting rations and some water in front of it


[15/01/2023 12:35 PM] deamonlord
So, I think we should keep it as a pet


[15/01/2023 12:36 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio lowers his blade a bit and awkwardly pauses. He scratches the back of his head with his other hand. **"Well this is... awkward. Striking it down now would not be the most honorable action..."**


[15/01/2023 12:40 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt walks over by hope. **"Well, you can try as I'm all for interested solutions to problems... This would make for a fantastic story. However, I think having some of us at the ready just in case is also a smart idea."**


[15/01/2023 12:42 PM] deamonlord
"I agree with both, Greyden, what is this creature?"


[15/01/2023 12:46 PM] Greydan
Greydan pokes his head out from behind a rock. **"It's a dingo mate.  Dangerous animal.  Just get rid of it."** He says obviously scared and concerned for the safety of his community.


[15/01/2023 1:06 PM] tkleprechaun
**"Well, up to you Hope. I will support you. However if this is extremely dangerous, I must stress that we get rid of it quickly as I don't want any innocent hurt because of our choices."**


[15/01/2023 1:27 PM] deamonlord
"I guess it would be smart to listen to the locals. these are their creatures after all." Hope says with a sigh


[15/01/2023 1:29 PM] tkleprechaun
**"Do we wake it or wait for it to wake before dealing with it? Or... Do we deal with it as is?"**


[15/01/2023 1:31 PM] deamonlord
"it will probably be safer to deal with it as is."


[15/01/2023 1:33 PM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio steps forward. **"Well as I said, it feels a little dishonorable. But I will shoulder the burden of putting it down quickly and cleanly."**


[15/01/2023 1:35 PM] deamonlord
"No my friend, it was my idea to try and tame it, it should be me to accept the consequences"


[15/01/2023 1:39 PM] tkleprechaun
**" I have no qualms about this at all. I don't see this as having consequences, but rather a story to tell. What starts at 2 of these beasts... Can easily via story become 3... then 4..."**


[15/01/2023 1:45 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt readies his rapier and looks to the others. **"Are you sure you don't want to wait?"**


[15/01/2023 1:45 PM] deamonlord
Hope pulls out his mace readying "I'm sure."


[15/01/2023 1:55 PM] tkleprechaun
Though he talks a big game about not having qualms, Tibalt lifts his blade to strike and sees the sleeping creature and changes his mind at the last moment stabbing the ground instead.

[15/01/2023 1:57 PM] deamonlord
Hope lifts his mace and looking down sadly at the sleeping creature, brings it down hard onto their back, leaving it bloody


[15/01/2023 2:22 PM] jameshurburgh
The dingo's body lies still and silence fills the area.


[15/01/2023 2:23 PM] Greydan
Greydan's face appears again. **"Are they... dead?  Is it safe?"** he asks, starting to emerge cautiously.


[15/01/2023 2:25 PM] jameshurburgh
Other faces start appearing to see if there are anymore threats.


[15/01/2023 3:07 PM] deamonlord
"I believe we are safe for now sir, they have been dispatched. And it seems your peanut is back in place?"


[15/01/2023 3:15 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt sheaths his rapier and also looks to Greydan. **"They are both certainly dead."** Passing the shoulders of Hope and Sergio he continues "** With heroes like these around, we will do whatever it takes to protect the innocent. "**


[15/01/2023 7:02 PM] jameshurburgh
The canines and people of the Big Peanut settlement cautiously creep back out into the open and a few come up to inspect the dingo corpses.  The young female canine who came in warning of the dingoes speaks up.  **"Oh thank you so much for savin' us!  I thought I was lost and I didn't know which way to go, but when I saw that Peanut above the trees I knew I was near home again.  If it wasn't for that I would have been eaten for sure."**


[15/01/2023 7:04 PM] Greydan
**"You fellas proved yourselves out there.  True heros you are.  Seems like we'll need more like you if these beasts keep on attacking like they do but we'll shore up some walls and we should be safe for now I reckon."** he says respectfully.  **"Look we don't have much but let us put on a feast for you tonight then I'll see you back to the city tomorrow if that's where you're headed.  Whatd'ya say?"**


[15/01/2023 10:52 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt smiles. †*"A feast would be most welcome my friend. I would love to even offer up some music while everything is being prepared if you wish."**


[15/01/2023 11:14 PM] tkleprechaun
Tibalt pulls out his cittern again and plucks a few songs tuning it. **"Here's a ditty I've enjoyed playing in the past."**

[16/01/2023 12:53 AM] l33tb4c0n
Sergio wraps his arms around the shoulders of Hemmer and Hope as Tibalt plays his song. **"This was a good job done, my new friends. I am honored to have fought alongside you all, and hope we can stand together as comrades in arms again. In fact, I wish to offer you each a position as a new recruit of the Brisbane branch of the Panache Fighting Company! You would be founding members! We can work out details when we get back to town... and I can begin formally setting up the company of course."**


[16/01/2023 2:46 AM] jvanblaricom0001
Smiling and nodding along.  **" I would join with you again. "**


[16/01/2023 6:22 AM] deamonlord
"a feast would be lovely, as would be getting to know the rest of you guys as we are hopefully not on a time crunch"


[16/01/2023 6:31 AM] jameshurburgh
The rest of the day is spent on preparations and you get to see the community in action.  They don't have much, but they have each other and they work together with smiles and laughs.  The feast is certainly not the best you've have, but it's well made and the little ones of the settlement try to flock around the heros and hear about the spiders and dingoes were cut down.  Greydan wakes you early the next morning as the sun is just starting to rise and let's you know that you should be able to make it by nightfall if you leave now.
Sure enough by the late afternoon you all back safely behind the expansive walls of Brisbandit again.


[16/01/2023 6:32 AM] Greydan
**"Thanks again champs.  You've made a whole lot of lives a whole lot better, ay."**


[16/01/2023 6:33 AM] deamonlord
"Glad to be of service to you and yours Mr. Greydan"


[16/01/2023 6:34 AM] tkleprechaun
Tibs looks to Greydan. **"Thank you for trusting in us as well! I'm glad we had this adventure and that we could help repair such a wonderful landmark!!"**


[16/01/2023 1:21 PM] jvanblaricom0001
**" I would be happy to help you again in the future.  As my faith grows so will my abilities.  Gond would be pleased by keeping your giant peanut standing monument."**
